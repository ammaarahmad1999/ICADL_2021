Abstract

We present an LSTM approach to
deletion-based sentence compression
where the task is to translate a sentence
into a sequence of zeros and ones, corresponding to token deletion decisions.
We demonstrate that even the most basic
version of the system, which is given no
syntactic information (no PoS or NE tags,
or dependencies) or desired compression
length, performs surprisingly well: around
30% of the compressions from a large test
set could be regenerated. We compare the
LSTM system with a competitive baseline
which is trained on the same amount of
data but is additionally provided with
all kinds of linguistic features. In an
experiment with human raters the LSTMbased model outperforms the baseline
achieving 4.5 in readability and 3.8 in
informativeness.

1 Introduction

Sentence compression is a standard NLP task
where the goal is to generate a shorter paraphrase
of a sentence. Dozens of systems have been introduced in the past two decades and most of them are
deletion-based: generated compressions are token
subsequences of the input sentences (Jing, 2000;
Knight & Marcu, 2000; McDonald, 2006; Clarke
& Lapata, 2008; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011, to
name a few).

Existing compression systems heavily use syntactic information to minimize chances of introducing grammatical mistakes in the output. A
common approach is to use only some syntactic
information (Jing, 2000; Clarke & Lapata, 2008,

360

among others) or use syntactic features as signals
in a Statistical model (McDonald, 2006). It is probably even more common to operate on syntactic
trees directly (dependency or constituency) and
generate compressions by pruning them (Knight
& Marcu, 2000; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;
Filippova & Altun, 2013, among others). Unfortunately, this makes such systems vulnerable to error
propagation as there is no way to recover from an
incorrect parse tree. With the state-of-the-art parsing systems achieving about 91 points in labeled
attachment accuracy (Zhang & McDonald, 2014),
the problem is not a negligible one. To our knowledge, there is no competitive compression system
so far which does not require any linguistic preprocessing but tokenization.

In this paper we research the following question: can a robust compression model be built
which only uses tokens and has no access to syntactic or other linguistic information? While phenomena like long-distance relations may seem to
make generation of grammatically correct compressions impossible, we are going to present an
evidence to the contrary. In particular, we will
present a model which benefits from the very recent advances in deep learning and uses word embeddings and Long Short Term Memory models
(LSTMs) to output surprisingly readable and informative compressions. Trained on a corpus of
less than two million automatically extracted parallel sentences and using a standard tool to obtain word embeddings, in its best and most simple configuration it achieves 4.5 points out of 5
in readability and 3.8 points in informativeness in
an extensive evaluation with human judges. We
believe that this is an important result as it may
suggest a new direction for sentence compression
research which is less tied to modeling linguistic

structures, especially syntactic ones, than the compression work so far.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 3
presents a competitive baseline which implements
the system of McDonald (2006) for large training
sets. The LSTM model and its three configurations are introduced in Section 4. The evaluation
set-up and a discussion on wins and losses with
examples are presented in Section 5 which is followed by the conclusions.

2 Related Work

The problem formulation we adopt in this paper
is very simple: for every token in the input sentence we ask whether it should be kept or dropped,
which translates into a sequence labeling problem
with just two labels: one and zero. The deletion approach is a standard one in compression research, although the problem is often formulated
over the syntactic structure and not the raw token sequence. That is, one usually drops constituents or prunes dependency edges (Jing, 2000;
Knight & Marcu, 2000; McDonald, 2006; Clarke
& Lapata, 2008; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;
Filippova & Altun, 2013). Thus, the relation to
existing compression work is that we also use the
deletion approach.

Recent advances in machine learning made it
possible to escape the typical paradigm of mapping a fixed dimensional input to a fixed dimensional output to mapping an input sequence onto
an output sequence. Even though many of these
models were proposed more than a decade ago,
it is not until recently that they have empirically
been shown to perform well. Indeed, core problems in natural language processing such as translation (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014;
Luong et al., 2014), parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014),
image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015; Xu et al.,
2015), or learning to execute small programs
(Zaremba & Sutskever, 2014) employed virtually
the same principles—the use of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). Thus, with regard to this line
of research, our work comes closest to the recent
machine translation work. An important difference is that we do not aim at building a model that
generates compressions directly but rather a model
which generates a sequence of deletion decisions.

A more complex translation model is also conceivable and may significantly advance work on
compression by paraphrasing, of which there have

361

not been many examples yet (Cohn & Lapata,
2008). However, in this paper our goal is to
demonstrate that a simple but robust deletionbased system can be built without using any linguistic features other than token boundaries. We
leave experiments with paraphrasing models to future work.

3 Baseline

We compare our model against the system of McDonald (2006) which also formulates sentence
compression as a binary sequence labeling problem. In contrast to our proposal, it makes use of
a large set of syntactic features which are treated
as soft evidence. The presence or absence of these
features is treated as signals which do not condition the output that the model can produce. Therefore the model is robust against noise present in
the precomputed syntactic structures of the input
sentences.

The system was implemented based on the description by McDonald (2006) with two changes
which were necessary due to the large size of the
training data set used for model fitting. The first
change was related to the learning procedure and
the second one to the family of features used.

Regarding the learning procedure, the original
model uses a large-margin learning framework,
namely MIRA (Crammer & Singer, 2003), but
with some minor changes as presented by McDonald et al. (2005). In this set-up, online learning is performed, and at each step an optimization procedure is made where K constraints are included, which correspond to the top-K solutions
for a given training observation. This optimization step is equivalent to a Quadratic Programming
problem if K > 1, which is time-costly to solve,
and therefore not adequate for the large amount
of data we used for training the model. Furthermore, in his publication McDonald states clearly
that different values of K did not actually have
a major impact on the final performance of the
model. Consequently, and for the sake of being
able to successfully train the model with largescale data, the learning procedure is implemented
as a distributed structured perceptron with iterative
parameter mixing (McDonald et al., 2010), where
each shard is processed with MIRA and K is set to
1.

Setting K = 1 will only affect the weight update described on line 4 of Figure 3 of McDonald
(2006), which is now expressed as:

wh — wl TT X Cy yy!

L(yt, y') — W + ey, y’
ley, wll?

ey, = F(x1,y:) — F(x, y’)

y’ = best(a; w)

where 7 = max (0

ly|

F(x,y) — df (@, L(yj-1), (yj)

The second change concerns the feature set
used. While McDonald’s original model contains
deep syntactic features coming from both dependency and constituency parse trees, we use only
dependency-based features. Additionally, and to
better compare the baseline with the LSTM models, we have included as an optional feature a
256-dimension embedding-vector representation
of each input word and its syntactic parent. The
vectors are pre-trained using the Skipgram model!
(Mikolov et al., 2013). Ultimately, our implementation of McDonald’s model contained 463,614 individual features, summarized in three categories:

e PoS features: Joint PoS tags of selected tokens. Unigram, bigram and trigram PoS context of selected and dropped tokens. All the
previous features conjoined with one indicating if the last two selected tokens are adjacent.

Deep syntactic features: Dependency labels
of taken and dropped tokens and their parent dependencies. Boolean features indicating syntactic relations between selected tokens (i.e., siblings, parents, leaves, etc.). Dependency label of the least common ancestor in the dependency tree between a batch
of dropped tokens. All the previous features
conjoined with the PoS tag of the involved
tokens.

Word features: Boolean features indicating
if a group of dropped nodes contain a complete or incomplete parenthesization. Wordembedding vectors of selected and dropped
tokens and their syntactic parents.

The model is fitted over ten epochs on the whole
training data, and for model selection a small development set consisting of 5,000 previously unseen sentences is used (none of them belonging to

'https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

362

the evaluation set). The automated metric used for
this selection was accuracy@1 which is the proportion of golden compressions which could be
fully reproduced. The performance on the development set plateaus when getting close to the last
epoch.

4 The LSTM model

Our approach is largely based on the sequence to
sequence paradigm proposed in Sutskever et al.
(2014). We train a model that maximizes the probability of the correct output given the input sentence. Concretely, for each training pair (X,Y),
we will learn a parametric model (with parameters
0), by solving the following optimization problem:

O° = argmax )— log p(Y |X; 6) (1)
0

X,Y

where the sum is assumed to be over all training examples. To model the probability p, we
use the same architecture described by Sutskever
et al. (2014). In particular, we use a RNN
based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
unit (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), designed
to avoid vanishing gradients and to remember
some long-distance dependences from the input
sequence. Figure | shows a basic LSTM architecture. The RNN 1s fed with input words X; (one
at a time), until we feed a special symbol “GO”’. It
is now a common practice (Sutskever et al., 2014;
Li & Jurafsky, 2015) to start feeding the input in
reversed order, as it has been shown to perform
better empirically. During the first pass over the
input, the network is expected to learn a compact, distributed representation of the input sentence, which will allow it to start generating the
right predictions when the second pass starts, after
the “GO” symbol is read.

We can apply the chain rule to decompose
Equation (1) as follows:

T

p(Y|X;6) =] [p@ilM,...,Y-1, X30) 2)
t=1

noting that we made no independence assumptions. Once we find the optimal 0*, we construct
our estimated compression Y as:

“aw

Y = arg max p(Y |X; 6") (3)

LSTM cell: Let us review the sequence-tosequence LSTM model. The Long Short Term
Memory model of Hochreiter & Schmidhuber
(1997) is defined as follows. Let 2, h+, and
m, be the input, control state, and memory state
at timestep t. Then, given a sequence of inputs

(x1,..., x7), the LSTM computes the h-sequence
(hi,..., hr) and the m-sequence (m1,...,m7)
as follows
4. = sigm(Wya; + Woht_1)

ht = m©o;

The operator © denotes element-wise multiplication, the matrices W,,..., Wg and the vector ho
are the parameters of the model, and all the nonlinearities are computed element-wise.

Stochastic gradient descent is used to maximize
the training objective (Eq. (1)) w.r.t. all the LSTM
parameters.

Network architecture: In these experiments we
have used the architecture depicted in Figure 3.
Following Vinyals et al. (2014), we have used
three stacked LSTM layers to allow the upper
layers to learn higher-order representations of the
input, interleaved with dropout layers to prevent
overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). The output
layer is a SoftMax classifier that predicts, after the
“GO” symbol is read, one of the following three

is the output label used for the “GO” input and the
end-of-sentence final period.

Input representation: In the simplest implementation, that we call LSTM, the input layer
has 259 dimensions. The first 256 contain the
embedding-vector representation of the current infunction DECODE(X)

put word, pre-trained using the Skipgram model?
(Mikolov et al., 2013). The final three dimensions
contain a one-hot-spot representation of the goldstandard label of the previous word (during training), or the generated label of the previous word
(during decoding).

For the LSTM+PAR architecture we first parse
the input sentence, and then we provide as input,
for each input word, the embedding-vector representation of that word and its parent word in
the dependency tree. If the current input is the
root node, then a special parent embedding is constructed with all nodes set to zero except for one
node. In these settings we want to test the hypothesis whether knowledge about the parent node can
be useful to decide if the current constituent is relevant or not for the compression. The dimensionality of the input layer in this case is 515. Similarly
to McDonald (2006), syntax is used here as a soft
feature in the model.

For the LSTM+PAR+PRES architecture, we
again parse the input sentence, and use a 518-sized
embedding vector, that includes:

e The embedding vector for the current word

(256 dimensions).
e The embedding vector for the parent word
(256 dimensions).

e The label predicted for the last word (3 di
mensions).

e A bit indicating whether the parent word has

*https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

already been seen and kept in the compression (1 dimension).

e A bit indicating whether the parent word has
already been seen but discarded (1 dimension).

e A bit indicating whether the parent word
comes later in the input (1 dimension).

Decoding: Eq. (3) involves searching through
all possible output sequences (given X). Contrary to the baseline, in the case of LSTMs the
complete previous history is taken into account
for each prediction and we cannot simplify Eq. (2)
with a Markov assumption. Therefore, the search
space at decoding time is exponential on the length
of the input, and we have used a beam-search procedure as described in Figure 2.

Fixed parameters: For training, we unfold the
network 120 times and make sure that none of our
training instances is longer than that. The learning rate is initialized at 2, with a decay factor of
0.96 every 300,000 traning steps. The dropping
probability for the dropout layers is 0.2. The number of nodes in each LSTM layer is always identical to the number of nodes in the input layer. We
have not tuned these parameters nor the number of
stacked layers.
5 Evaluation

5.1 Data

Both the LSTM systems we introduced and the
baseline require a training set of a considerable
size. In particular, the LSTM model uses 256dimensional embeddings of token sequences and
cannot be expected to perform well if trained on
a thousand parallel sentences, which is the size of
the commonly used data sets (Knight & Marcu,
2000; Clarke & Lapata, 2006). Following the
method of Filippova & Altun (2013), we collect
a much larger corpus of about two million parallel sentence-compression instances from the news
where every compression is a subsequence of tokens from the input. For testing, we use the publicly released set of 10,000 sentence-compression
pairs®. We take the first 200 sentences from this set
for the manual evaluation with human raters, and
the first 1,000 sentences for the automatic evaluation.

5.2 Experiments

We evaluate the baseline and our systems on the
200-sentence test set in an experiment with human
raters. The raters were asked to rate readability
and informativeness of compressions given the input which are the standard evaluation metrics for
compression. The former covers the grammatical
correctness, comprehensibility and fluency of the
output while the latter measures the amount of important content preserved in the compression.

Additionally, for experiments on the development set, we used two metrics for automatic evaluation: per-sentence accuracy (1.e., how many
compressions could be fully reproduced) and
word-based Fl-score. The latter differs from
the RASP-based relation F-score by Riezler et al.
(2003) in that we simply compute the recall and
precision in terms of tokens kept in the golden
and the generated compressions. We report these
results for completeness although it is the results
of the human evaluation from which we draw our
conclusions.

Compression ratio: The three versions of our
system (LSTM*) and the baseline (MIRA) have
comparable compression ratios (CR) which are
defined as the length of the compression in characters divided over the sentence length. Since the

Shttp://storage.googleapis.com/
sentencecomp/compressiondata.json

365

ratios are very close, a comparison of the systems’
scores is justified (Napoles et al., 2011).

Automatic evaluation: A total of 1,000 sentence pairs from the test sett were used in the automatic evaluation. The results are summarized in
Table 1.

 

FI Acc CR

MIRA 0.75 0.21 0.37

LSTM 0.80 0.30 0.39

LSTM+PAR 0.81 0.31 0.38

LSTM+PAR+PRES | 0.82 0.34 0.38
Table 1: Fl-score, per-sentence accuracy and

compression ratio for the baseline and the systems

There is a significant difference in performance of
the MIRA baseline and the LSTM models, both in
terms of Fl-score and in accuracy. More than 30%
of golden compressions could be fully regenerated
by the LSTM systems which is in sharp contrast
with the 20% of MIRA. The differences in F-score
between the three versions of LSTM are not significant, all scores are close to 0.81.

Evaluation with humans: The first 200 sentences from the set of 1,000 used in the automatic
evaluation were compressed by each of the four
systems. Every sentence-compression pair was
rated by three raters who were asked to select a
rating on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from
one to five. In very few cases (around 1%) the
ratings were inconclusive (i.e., /, 3, 5 were given
to the same pair) and had to be skipped. Table 2
summarizes the results.

The results indicate that the LSTM models produce more readable and more informative compressions. Interestingly, there is no benefit in using the syntactic information, at least not with

the amount of parallel data we had at our disposal. The simple LSTM model which only uses
token embeddings to generate a sequence of deletion decisions significantly outperforms the baseline which was given not only embeddings but also
syntactic and other features.

Discussion: What are the wins and losses of the
LSTM systems? Figure 4 presents some of the
evaluated sentence-compression pairs. In terms
of readability, the basic LSTM system performed
surprisingly well. Only in a few cases (out of 200)
did it get an average score of two or three. Sentences which pose difficulty to the model are the
ones with quotes, intervening commas, or other
uncommon punctuation patterns. For example, in
the second sentence in Figure 4, if one removes
from the input the age modifiers and the preceding commas, the words and Chris Martin are not

366

dropped and the output compression is grammatical, preserving both conjoined elements.

With regard to informativeness, the difficult
cases are those where there is very little to be removed and where the model still removed more
than a half to achieve the compression ratio it observed in the training data. For example, the only
part that can be removed from the fourth sentence
in Figure 4 is the modifier of police, everything
else being important content. Similarly, in the fifth
sentence the context of the event must be retained
in the compression for the event to be interpreted
correctly.

Arguably, such cases would also be difficult for
other systems. In particular, recognizing when the
context is crucial is a problem that can be solved
only by including deep semantic and discourse
features which has not been attempted yet. And
sentences with quotes (direct speech, a song or a
book title, etc.) are challenging for parsers which
in turn provide important signals for most compression systems.

The bottom of Figure 4 contains examples of
good compressions. Even though for a significant number of input sentences the compression
was a continuous subsequence of tokens, there are
many discontinuous compressions. In particular,
the LSTM model learned to drop appositions, no
matter how long they are, temporal expressions,
optional modifiers, introductory clauses, etc.

Our understanding of why the extended model
(LSTM+PAR+PRES) performed worse in the human evlauation than the base model is that, in
the absence of syntactic features, the basic LSTM
learned a model of syntax useful for compression,
while LSTM++, which was given syntactic information, learned to optimize for the particular way
the ’ golden” set was created (tree pruning). While
the automatic evaluation penalized all deviations
from the single golden variant, in human evals
there was no penalty for readable alternatives.

6 Conclusions

We presented, to our knowledge, a first attempt at
building a competitive compression system which
is given no linguistic features from the input. The
two important components of the system are (1)
word embeddings, which can be obtained by anyone either pre-trained, or by running word2vec
on a large corpus, and (2) an LSTM model which
draws on the very recent advances in research
on RNNs. The training data of about two million sentence-compression pairs was collected automatically from the Internet.

Our results clearly indicate that a compression
model which is not given syntactic information explicitly in the form of features may still achieve
competitive performance. The high readability
and informativeness scores assigned by human
raters support this claim. In the future, we are
planning to experiment with more “interesting”
paraphrasing models which translate the input not
into a zero-one sequence but into words.
