Abstract

We propose a selective encoding model
to extend the sequence-to-sequence framework for abstractive sentence summarization. It consists of a sentence encoder,
a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The selective gate
network constructs a second level sentence representation by controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder.
The second level representation is tailored
for sentence summarization task, which
leads to better performance. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword,
DUC 2004 and MSR abstractive sentence
summarization datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed selective
encoding model outperforms the state-ofthe-art baseline models.

1 Introduction

Sentence summarization aims to shorten a given
sentence and produce a brief summary of it. This
is different from document level summarization
task since it is hard to apply existing techniques
in extractive methods, such as extracting sentence
level features and ranking sentences. Early works
propose using rule-based methods (Zajic et al.,
2007), syntactic tree pruning methods (Knight and
Marcu, 2002), statistical machine translation techniques (Banko et al., 2000) and so on for this task.
We focus on abstractive sentence summarization
task in this paper.

Recently, neural network models have been applied in this task. Rush et al. (2015) use autoconstructed sentence-headline pairs to train a neu

ral network summarization model. They use a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder
and feed-forward neural network language model
decoder for this task. Chopra et al. (2016) extend their work by replacing the decoder with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nallapati et al.
(2016) follow this line and change the encoder to
RNN to make it a full RNN based sequence-tosequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014).

Figure 1: An abstractive sentence summarization
system may produce the output summary by distilling the salient information from the highlight to
generate a fluent sentence. We model the distilling
process with selective encoding.

All the above works fall into the encodingdecoding paradigm, which first encodes the input sentence to an abstract representation and
then decodes the intended output sentence based
on the encoded information. As an extension
of the encoding-decoding framework, attentionbased approach (Bahdanau et al., 2015) has been
broadly used: the encoder produces a list of vectors for all tokens in the input, and the decoder
uses an attention mechanism to dynamically extract encoded information and align with the output tokens. This approach achieves huge success
in tasks like machine translation, where alignment
between all parts of the input and output are required. However, in abstractive sentence summarization, there is no explicit alignment relationship
between the input sentence and the summary ex

cept for the extracted common words. The challenge here is not to infer the alignment, but to select the highlights while filtering out secondary
information in the input. A desired work-flow
for abstractive sentence summarization is encoding, selection, and decoding. After selecting the
important information from an encoded sentence,
the decoder produces the output summary using
the selected information. For example, in Figure 1, given the input sentence, the summarization system first selects the important information,
and then rephrases or paraphrases to produce a
well-organized summary. Although this is implicitly modeled in the encoding-decoding framework,
we argue that abstractive sentence summarization
shall benefit from explicitly modeling this selection process.

In this paper we propose Selective Encoding for
Abstractive Sentence Summarization (SEASS).
We treat the sentence summarization as a threephase task: encoding, selection, and decoding. It
consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and a summary decoder. First, the sentence
encoder reads the input words through an RNN
unit to construct the first level sentence representation. Then the selective gate network selects the
encoded information to construct the second level
sentence representation. The selective mechanism
controls the information flow from encoder to decoder by applying a gate network according to
the sentence information, which helps improve encoding effectiveness and release the burden of the
decoder. Finally, the attention-equipped decoder
generates the summary using the second level sentence representation. We conduct experiments
on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and Microsoft
Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets.
Our SEASS model achieves 17.54 ROUGE-2 FI,
9.56 ROUGE-2 recall and 10.63 ROUGE-2 Fl on
these test sets respectively, which improves performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

2 Related Work

Abstractive sentence summarization, also known
as sentence compression and similar to headline
generation, is used to help compress or fuse the
selected sentences in extractive document summarization systems since they may inadvertently
include unnecessary information. The sentence
summarization task has been long connected to the
headline generation task. There are some previous

methods to solve this task, such as the linguistic
rule-based method (Dorr et al., 2003). As for the
statistical machine learning based methods, Banko
et al. (2000) apply statistical machine translation
techniques by modeling headline generation as a
translation task and use 8000 article-headline pairs
to train the system.

Rush et al. (2015) propose leveraging news data
in Annotated English Gigaword (Napoles et al.,
2012) corpus to construct large scale parallel data
for sentence summarization task. They propose an
ABS model, which consists of an attentive Convolutional Neural Network encoder and an neural
network language model (Bengio et al., 2003) decoder. On this Gigaword test set and DUC 2004
test set, the ABS model produces the state-of-theart results. Chopra et al. (2016) extend this work,
which keeps the CNN encoder but replaces the decoder with recurrent neural networks. Their experiments showes that the CNN encoder with RNN
decoder model performs better than Rush et al.
(2015). Nallapati et al. (2016) further change the
encoder to an RNN encoder, which leads to a full
RNN sequence-to-sequence model. Besides, they
enrich the encoder with lexical and statistic features which play important roles in traditional feature based summarization systems, such as NER
and POS tags, to improve performance. Experiments on the Gigaword and DUC 2004 test sets
show that the above models achieve state-of-theart results.

Gu et al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. (2016)
come up similar ideas that summarization task can
benefit from copying words from input sentences.
Gu et al. (2016) propose CopyNet to model the
copying action in response generation, which also
applies for summarization task. Gulcehre et al.
(2016) propose a switch gate to control whether
to copy from source or generate from decoder vocabulary. Zeng et al. (2016) also propose using
copy mechanism and add a scalar weight on the
gate of GRU/LSTM for this task. Cheng and Lapata (2016) use an RNN based encoder-decoder for
extractive summarization of documents.

Yu et al. (2016) propose a segment to segment neural transduction model for sequence-tosequence framework. The model introduces a
latent segmentation which determines correspondences between tokens of the input sequence and
the output sequence. Experiments on this task
show that the proposed transduction model per
1096
forms comparable to the ABS model. Shen et al.
(2016) propose to apply Minimum Risk Training (MRT) in neural machine translation to directly optimize the evaluation metrics. Ayana et al.
(2016) apply MRT on abstractive sentence summarization task and the results show that optimizing for ROUGE improves the test performance.

3 Problem Formulation

For sentence summarization, given an input sentence © = (%1,%2,...,%), where n is the sentence length, x; € V, and Y, is the source vocabulary, the system summarizes x by producing
y = (1, Y2;---, Yl), where 1 < n is the summary
length , y; © VY; and ); is the target vocabulary.

If |y| C |a|, which means all words in summary y must appear in given input, we denote this
as extractive sentence summarization. If |y| Z |,
which means not all words in summary come from
input sentence, we denote this as abstractive sentence summarization. Table 1 provides an example. We focus on abstracive sentence summarization task in this paper.

4 Model

As shown in Figure 2, our model consists of a
sentence encoder using the Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), a selective gate network
and an attention-equipped GRU decoder. First, the
bidirectional GRU encoder reads the input words
x = (X1,%2,..., 2p) and builds its representation
(hi, ha,...,hn). Then the selective gate selects
and filters the word representations according to
the sentence meaning representation to produce a
tailored sentence word representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Lastly, the GRU
decoder produces the output summary with attention to the tailored representation. In the following
sections, we introduce the sentence encoder, the
selective mechanism, and the summary decoder
respectively.

4.1 Sentence Encoder

The role of the sentence encoder is to read the input sentence and construct the basic sentence representation. Here we employ a bidirectional GRU
(BiGRU) as the recurrent unit, where GRU is defined as:

2% = 0(W,|2;, hi_1]) (1)
ri = 0(W,[2;, his) (2)
hy = tanh(W,[2;, 77 © hy_1]) (3)
hy = (1— %) Ohx1t+ 40 hi (4)

where W., W,. and W,, are weight matrices.

The BiGRU consists of a forward GRU and a
backward GRU. The forward GRU reads the input
sentence word embeddings from left to right and
gets a sequence of hidden states, (hi, ho,..., hn).
The backward GRU reads the input sentence
embeddings reversely, from right to left, and
results in another sequence of hidden states,
(ht, ho, Pay hn):

GRU (a;, hi—1) (5)
; = GRU (ai, hi+1) (6)

| a=!

The initial states of the BiGRU are set to zero
vectors, 1.e., hy = 0 and hin = 0. After reading the
sentence, the forward and backward hidden states
are concatenated, i.e., h; = (he: hil, to get the basic sentence representation.

4.2 Selective Mechanism

In the sequence-to-sequence machine translation
(MT) model, the encoder and decoder are responsible for mapping input sentence information to
a list of vectors and decoding the sentence representation vectors to generate an output sentence
(Bahdanau et al., 2015). Some previous works apply this framework to summarization generation
tasks (Nallapati et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2016). However, abstractive sentence
summarization is different from MT in two ways.
First, there is no explicit alignment relationship
between the input sentence and the output summary except for the common words. Second, summarization task needs to keep the highlights and
remove the unnecessary information, while MT
needs to keep all information literally.

Herein, we propose a selective mechanism to
model the selection process for abstractive sentence summarization. The selective mechanism

Encoder

Figure 2: Overview of the Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization (SEASS).

extends the sequence-to-sequence model by constructing a tailored representation for abstractive
sentence summarization task. Concretely, the selective gate network in our model takes two vector
inputs, the sentence word vector h; and the sentence representation vector s. The sentence word
vector fh; is the output of the BiGRU encoder and
represents the meaning and context information of
word x;. The sentence vector s is used to represent
the meaning of the sentence. For each word x;,
the selective gate network generates a gate vector
sGate; using h,; and s, then the tailored representation is constructed, i.e., hi.

In detail, we concatenate the last forward hidden state lin and backward hidden state hy as the
sentence representation s:

hy

i. (7)

Ss =

For each time step 2, the selective gate takes the
sentence representation s and BiGRU hidden h, as
inputs to compute the gate vector sGate;:

sGate; = o(W,h; + Uss + 5) (8)
h, = h; © sGate; (9)

where W, and U, are weight matrices, b is the
bias vector, o denotes sigmoid activation function, and © is element-wise multiplication. After
the selective gate network, we obtain another sequence of vectors (h,,h5,...,hi,). This new sequence is then used as the input sentence representation for the decoder to generate the summary.

4.3 Summary Decoder

On top of the sentence encoder and the selective
gate network, we use GRU with attention as the
decoder to produce the output summary.

At each decoding time step t, the GRU reads the
previous word embedding w;_1 and previous context vector cy_1 aS inputs to compute the new hidden state s;. To initialize the GRU hidden state, we
use a linear layer with the last backward encoder
hidden state h1 as input:

8, = GRU(wr-1, Ce-1, St-1)
so = tanh(Wah1 + b)

(10)
(11)

where W,, is the weight matrix and 6 is the bias
vector.

The context vector c; for current time step t¢ is
computed through the concatenate attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015), which matches the
current decoder state s; with each encoder hidden
state h to get an importance score. The importance scores are then normalized to get the current
context vector by weighted sum:

44 =v, tanh(Was:_1 + Ugh) (12)
exp(ez.;)
u“, = = (13)
mt S3™_exp(Er,i)
c= > anh (14)
i=1

We then combine the previous word embedding
w;_1, the current context vector c;, and the decoder state s; to construct the readout state r;. The
readout state is then passed through a maxout hidden layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013) to predict the

1098
next word with a softmax layer over the decoder
vocabulary.

Te = W-wr-1 a U,c¢ a. V>-St (15)
me = [max{ry2j-1, 71,2; }j=1,...4 (16)
P(YtlY1,--+>Ye-1) = Softmax(Wom,) (17)

where W,, U,, W,., U;, V, and W, are weight
matrices. Readout state r; is a 2d-dimensional
vector, and the maxout layer (Equation 16) picks
the max value for every two numbers in 7; and produces a d-dimensional vector ™;.

4.4 Objective Function

Our goal is to maximize the output summary probability given the input sentence. Therefore, we optimize the negative log-likelihood loss function:

1(8) =~ S> log p(ylx)
(

r,y)ED

(18)

where DY denotes a set of parallel sentencesummary pairs and @ is the model parameter. We
use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with minibatch to learn the model parameter 0.

5 Experiments

In this section we introduce the dataset we use, the
evaluation metric, the implementation details, the
baselines we compare to, and the performance of
our system.

5.1 Dataset

Training Set For our training set, we use a parallel corpus which is constructed from the Annotated English Gigaword dataset (Napoles et al.,
2012) as mentioned in Rush et al. (2015). The
parallel corpus is produced by pairing the first sentence and the headline in the news article with
some heuristic rules. We use the script! released
by Rush et al. (2015) to pre-process and extract the
training and development datasets. The script performs various basic text normalization, including
PTB tokenization, lower-casing, replacing all digit
characters with #, and replacing word types seen
less than 5 times with (unk). The extracted corpus
contains about 3.8M sentence-summary pairs for
the training set and 189K examples for the development set.

For our test set, we use the English Gigaword,
DUC 2004, and Microsoft Research Abstractive
Text Compression test sets.

‘https: //github.com/facebook/NAMAS

English Gigaword Test Set We randomly sample 8000 pairs from the extracted development set
as our development set since it is relatively large.
For the test set, we use the same randomly heldout test set of 2000 sentence-summary pairs as
Rush et al. (2015).”

We also find that except for the empty titles, this
test set has some invalid lines like the input sentence containing only one word. Therefore, we
further sample 2000 pairs as our internal test set
and release it for future works’.

DUC 2004 Test Set We employ DUC 2004 data
for tasks 1 & 2 (Over et al., 2007) in our experiments as one of the test sets since it is too small to
train a neural network model on. The dataset pairs
each document with 4 different human-written reference summaries which are capped at 75 bytes. It
has 500 input sentences with each sentence paired
with 4 summaries.

MSR-ATC Test Set Toutanova et al. (2016) release a new dataset for sentence summarization
task by crowdsourcing. This dataset contains approximately 6,000 source text sentences with multiple manually-created summaries (about 26,000
sentence-summary pairs in total). Toutanova et al.
(2016) provide a standard split of the data into
training, development, and test sets, with 4,936,
448 and 785 input sentences respectively. Since
the training set is too small, we only use the test set
as one of our test sets. We denote this dataset as
MSR-ATC (Microsoft Research Abstractive Text
Compression) test set in the following.

Table 2 summarizes the statistic information of
the three datasets we used.

5.2. Evaluation Metric

We employ ROUGE (Lin, 2004) as our evaluation
metric. ROUGE measures the quality of summary
by computing overlapping lexical units, such as
unigram, bigram, trigram, and longest common
subsequence (LCS). It becomes the standard evaluation metric for DUC shared tasks and popular
for summarization evaluation. Following previous
work, we use ROUGE-1 (unigram), ROUGE-2 (bi
°Thanks to Rush et al. (2015), we acquired the test set they
used. Following Chopra et al. (2016), we remove pairs with
empty titles resulting in slightly different accuracy compared
to Rush et al. (2015) for their systems. The cleaned test set
contains 1951 sentence-summary pairs.

5.3. Implementation Details

Model Parameters The input and output vocabularies are collected from the training data, which
have 119,504 and 68,883 word types respectively.
We set the word embedding size to 300 and all
GRU hidden state sizes to 512. We use dropout
(Srivastava et al., 2014) with probability p = 0.5.

Model Training We initialize model parameters randomly using a Gaussian distribution with
Xavier scheme (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). We use
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) as our optimizing
algorithm. For the hyperparameters of Adam optimizer, we set the learning rate a = 0.001, two
momentum parameters 6, = 0.9 and 62 = 0.999
respectively, and « = 107°. During training, we
test the model performance (ROUGE-2 F1) on development set for every 2,000 batches. We halve
the Adam learning rate a if the ROUGE-2 F1 score
drops for twelve consecutive tests on development
set. We also apply gradient clipping (Pascanu
et al., 2013) with range [—5, 5] during training. To
both speed up the training and converge quickly,
we use mini-batch size 64 by grid search.

Beam Search We use beam search to generate
multiple summary candidates to get better results.
To avoid favoring shorter outputs, we average the
ranking score along the beam path by dividing it
by the number of generated words. To both decode
fast and get better results, we set the beam size to

12 in our experiments.

5.4 Baseline

We compare SEASS model with the following
State-of-the-art baselines:

ABS Rush et al. (2015) use an attentive CNN encoder and NNLM decoder to do the sentence
summarization task. We trained this baseline
model with the released code! and evaluate
it with our internal English Gigaword test set
and MSR-ATC test set.

ABS+ Based on ABS model, Rush et al. (2015)
further tune their model using DUC 2003
dataset, which leads to improvements on
DUC 2004 test set.

CAs2s As an extension of the ABS model,
Chopra et al. (2016) use a convolutional
attention-based encoder and RNN decoder,
which outperforms the ABS model.

Feats2s Nallapati et al. (2016) use a full
RNN sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder
model and add some features to enhance the
encoder, such as POS tag, NER, and so on.

Luong-NMT Neural machine translation model
of Luong et al. (2015) with two-layer LSTMs
for the encoder-decoder with 500 hidden
units in each layer implemented in (Chopra
et al., 2016).

s2statt We also implement a _ sequence-tosequence model with attention as our
baseline and denote it as “‘s2s+att’’.

5.5 Results

We report ROUGE Fl, ROUGE recall and ROUGE
Fl for English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSRATC test sets respectively. We use the official
ROUGE script (version 1.5.5) + to evaluate the
summarization quality in our experiments. For
English Gigaword’ and MSR-ATC® test sets, the
outputs have different lengths so we evaluate the
system with Fl metric. As for the DUC 2004 test
set’, the task requires the system to produce a fixed
length summary (75 bytes), therefore we employ
ROUGE recall as the evaluation metric. To satisfy
the length requirement, we decode the output summary to a roughly expected length following Rush
et al. (2015).

satisfies the minimum length requirement. As
summarized in Table 5, our SEASS outperforms
all the baseline methods and achieves 29.21, 9.56
and 25.51 for ROUGE 1, 2 and L recall. Compared
to the ABS+ model which is tuned using DUC
2003 data, our model performs significantly better by 1.07 ROUGE-?2 recall score and is trained
only with English Gigaword sentence-summary
data without being tuned using DUC data.

best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
reports ROUGE metric scores on the MSR-ATC
dataset. Note that we only compare our model
with ABS since the others are not publicly available. Our SEASS achieves 10.63 ROUGE-2 F1 and
outperforms the s2s+att baseline by 1.02 points.

6 Discussion

In this section, we first compare the performance
of SEASS with the s2s+att baseline model to illustrate that the proposed method succeeds in selecting information and building tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization. We
then analyze selective encoding by visualizing the
heat map.

Effectiveness of Selective Encoding We further test the SEASS model with different sentence
lengths on English Gigaword test sets, which are
merged from the Rush et al. (2015) test set and our
internal test set. The length of sentences in the test
sets ranges from 10 to 80. We group the sentences
with an interval of 4 and get 18 different groups
and we draw the first 14 groups. We find that the
performance curve of our SEASS model always
appears to be on the top of that of s2s+att with a
certain margin. For the groups of 16, 20, 24, 32,
56 and 60, the SEASS model obtains big improvements compared to the s2st+att model. Overall,
these improvements on all groups indicate that the
selective encoding method benefits the abstractive
sentence summarization task.

Saliency Heat Map of Selective Gate Since the
output of the selective gate network is a high dimensional vector, it is hard to visualize all the gate
values. We use the method in Li et al. (2016) to
visualize the contribution of the selective gate to
the final output, which can be approximated by the
first derivative. Given sentence words x with associated output summary y, the trained model associates the pair (2, y) with a score S,,(x). The goal
is to decide which gate g associated with a specific word makes the most significant contribution
to S,(x). We approximate the S,,(g) by computing the first-order Taylor expansion since the score
S,(a) is a highly non-linear function in the deep
neural network models:

Sy(g) + w(g)' g +b (19)

where w(q) is first the derivative of S,, with respect to the gate g:

We then draw the Euclidean norm of the first
derivative of the output y with respect to the selective gate g associated with each input words.

Figure 3 shows an example of the first derivative
heat map, in which most of the important words
are selected by the selective gate such as “europe’, “slammed”, “unacceptable”, “conditions”,
and “france”. We can observe that the selective
gate determines the importance of each word before decoder, which releases the burden of it by
providing tailored sentence encoding.

7 Conclusion

This paper proposes a selective encoding model
which extends the sequence-to-sequence model
for abstractive sentence summarization task. The
selective mechanism mimics one of the human
summarizers’ behaviors, selecting important information before writing down the summary. With
the proposed selective mechanism, we build an
end-to-end neural network summarization model
which consists of three phases: encoding, selection, and decoding. Experimental results show
that the selective encoding model greatly improves
the performance with respect to the state-of-theart methods on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and
MSR-ATC test sets.
