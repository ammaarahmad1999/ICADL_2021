Abstract

A quality abstractive summary should not only
copy salient source texts as summaries but
should also tend to generate new conceptual
words to express concrete details. Inspired
by the popular pointer generator sequence-tosequence model, this paper presents a concept
pointer network for improving these aspects of
abstractive summarization. The network leverages knowledge-based, context-aware conceptualizations to derive an extended set of candidate concepts. The model then points to the
most appropriate choice using both the concept set and original source text. This joint approach generates abstractive summaries with
higher-level semantic concepts. The training model is also optimized in a way that
adapts to different data, which is based on a
novel method of distantly-supervised learning
guided by reference summaries and testing set.
Overall, the proposed approach provides statistically significant improvements over several state-of-the-art models on both the DUC2004 and Gigaword datasets. A human evaluation of the model’s abstractive abilities also
supports the quality of the summaries produced within this framework.

1 Introduction

Abstractive summarization (ABS) has gained
overwhelming success owing to a tremendous
development of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
model and its variants (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra
et al., 2016; Paulus et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018;
Gao et al., 2019). In tandem with seq2seq models, pointer generator was developed by See et al.
(2017) as a solution to tackle the rare words and
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem associated with
generative-based models. The idea behind is to
use attention as a pointer to determine the probability of generating a word from both a vocab

ulary distribution and the source text. Pointer
generator networks have also been extensively accepted by the ABS community due to their efficacy with long document summaries (Chen and
Bansal, 2018; Hsu et al., 2018), title summarization (Sun et al., 2018), etc.

However, the current power of abstractive summarization falls short of their potential. As the example in Figure 1 shows, a seq2seq model with a
pointer mechanism (marked as the direct pointer)
is likely to merely copy parts of the original text to
form a summary using keywords and phrases, such
as “317 athletes”. Conversely, a more humanlike summary would be based on one’s own understanding of the detail in the words, expressed
as higher-level concepts drawn from world know]edge—like using the word “group” to replace
“athletes and officials”. This indicates that a good
summary should not simply copy original material, it should also generate new and even abstract
concepts that reflect high-level semantics.

Therefore, a pointer generator network that
solely considers the source material to generate
a summary does not adequately satisfy the needs
of high-quality abstractive summarization. We
argue that concepts have a greater ability to express deeper meanings than verbatim words. As
such, it is essential to explore the potential of us
  
ing concepts from world knowledge to assist with
abstractive summarization. Our developed model
not only points to informative source texts but also
leverages conceptual words from human knowledge in the summaries it generates.

Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel model
based on a concept pointer generator that encourages the generation of conceptual and abstract
words. As a hidden benefit, the model also alleviates the OOV problems. Our model uses pointer
network to capture the salient information from a
source text, and then employs another pointer to
generalize the detailed words according to their
upper level of expressions. Finally, the output
is also consistent with language model by the
seq2seq generator. Unique to our concept pointer
is a set of concept candidates particular for a word
that is drawn from a huge knowledge base. The
set of candidates adheres to a concept distribution,
where the probability of each concept being generated is linked to how strongly the candidate represents each word. Moreover, the concept distribution is iteratively updated to better explain the
target word given the context of the source material and inherent semantics in the texts. Hence, the
learned concept pointer points to the most suitable
and expressive concepts or words. The optimization function is adaptive so as to cater for different
datasets with distantly-supervised training. The
network is then optimized end-to-end using reinforcement learning, with the distant-supervision
strategy as a complement to further improve the
summary.

Overall, the contributions of this paper are: 1)
a novel concept pointer generator network that
leverages context-aware conceptualization and a
concept pointer, both of which are jointly integrated into the generator to deliver informative and abstract-oriented summaries; 2) a novel
distant supervision training strategy that favors
model adaptation and generalization, which results in performance that outperforms the wellaccepted evaluation-based reinforcement learning
optimization on a test-only dataset in terms of
ROUGE metrics; 3) a statistical analysis of quantitative results and human evaluations from comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art
models that shows the proposed method provides
promising performance.

2 Related Work

Abstractive summarization supposedly digests and
understands the source content and, consequently,
the generated summaries are typically a reorganization of the wording that sometimes form new
sentences. Historically, abstractive summarization has been performed through rule-based sentence selection (Dorr et al., 2003), key information extraction (Genest and Lapalme, 2011), syntactic parsing (Bing et al., 2015) and so on. However, more recently, seq2seq models with attention
have played a more dominant role in generating
abstractive summaries (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra
et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; Zhou et al.,
2017). Extensions to the seq2seq approach include
an intra-decoder attention (Paulus et al., 2017) and
coverage vectors (See et al., 2017) to decrease repetition in phrasing. Copy mechanism (Gu et al.,
2016) has been integrated into these models to
tackle OOV problem. Zhou et al. (2018) went
on to propose SeqCopyNet which copies complete
sequences from an input sentence to further maintain the readability of the generated summary.

Pointer mechanism (Vinyals et al., 2015) has
drawn much attention in text summarization (See
et al., 2017), because this technique not only provides a potential solution for rare words and OOV
but also extends abstractive summarization in a
flexible way (Celikyilmaz et al., 2018). Further,
pointer generator models can effectively adaptive
to both extractor and abstractor networks (Chen
and Bansal, 2018), and summaries can be generated by incorporating a pointer-generator and
multiple relevant tasks (Guo et al., 2018), such
as question or entailment generation, or multiple
source texts (Sun et al., 2018).

However, work particularly targets the problem
of the abstraction is rare. Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is used to transform a sentence
into a concept graph, then merge those similar
concept nodes to form a new summary graph (Liu
et al., 2018). Concepts are also incorporated as
auxiliary features (Guo et al., 2017). Kryscinski
et al. (2018) and Weber et al. (2018) define the
number of new n-grams as the primary criteria of
abstractiveness. This makes sense in most cases.
But, we believe that abstraction means summarizing detailed content with higher-level semantically
related concepts, which has motivated the development of the model proposed in this paper.
3. The Proposed Model

Neural abstractive summarization can be described as a generation process where a sequential input is summarized into a shorter sequential
output through a neural network. Suppose that the
sequential input w = {x1,...,%j,..., Up} is a Sequence of n number of words, and 2 is the index of
the input. The shorter (1.e., summarized) sequence
of output is denoted as y = {y1,..-,Yt,---;Ym}
with number of m words, and ¢ indicates a time
step. As Figure 2 shows, our model consists of
two sub-modules —an encoder-decoder module
and the proposed concept pointer generator module.

3.1 Encoder-Decoder Framework

This process is formulated as an encoder-decoder
framework that consists of an encoder and an
attention-equipped decoder. We use a two-layer
bi-directional LSTM-RNN encoder and one-layer
uni-directional LSTM-RNN decoder along with
attention mechanism.

Formally, the encoder produces sequential hid
7 ;

den states as (hy,..., R,,) and (hi, ..., Ay) in
the corresponding positions, and the bi-directional
hy = frustm (hi-1, 2). Each word 2; in the
sequence can be represented as a concatenation
of the bi-directional hidden states, ie, h; =
[h;, hy]. The decoder generates a target summary from a vocabulary distribution Pyocqp(w),
which is based on a context vector h; through the
following process:

Procab(w) = P(ytlYer: LZ, 0) (1)
=sfm(W 2(W (s+, he | + b;) + bz)

where s; is the hidden state of the decoder at time
step t , and h; is the context vector at time step
t. W 1, Wo, 61, be are trainable parameters, and
sfm(-) is short for softmax function.

The context vector h; is computed by a
weighted sum of the hidden representations of the
source text, and the weight is denoted as the attention Qj.

n

(2)
ay; = sfm(v! tanh(W),h; + Ws; +b))

The softmax function normalizes the vector
of a distribution over the input position, and
v, W;,, Ws, 6 are trainable parameters.

3.2 Concept Pointer Generator

Pointer networks use attention as a pointer to select segments of the input as outputs (Vinyals
et al., 2015). As such, a pointer network is a
suitable mechanism for extracting salient information, while remaining flexible enough to interface
with a seq2seq model for generating an abstractive
summarization (See et al., 2017). Our proposed
model is essentially an upgrade to this configuration that integrates a new concept pointer network
within a unified framework.

3.2.1 Context-aware Conceptualization

“Understanding” the instances of a word requires
a taxonomic knowledge base that relates those
words to a concept space. In our model, we use
an isA taxonomy, called the Microsoft Concept
Graph! (Wang et al., 2015), to serve this purpose
for two reasons (Wang and Wang, 2016). First,
this graph provides a huge concept space with
multi-word terms that cover concepts of worldly
facts as concepts, instances, relationships, and values”. Second, the relationships between concepts
and entities are probabilistic as a measure of how
strongly they are related. Moreover, the probabilities are trustworthy given they have been derived from evidence found in billions of webpages,
search log data, and other existing taxonomies.
Our model is data-driven and, therefore, is more
easily adaptable with probabilities. All these characteristics make the Microsoft Concept Graph a
suitable choice for our model. More detailed examples are available in Appendix A.

The concept graph specifies the probability that
each instance x belongs to a concept c, p(c|x).
Given a word xz, we have a distribution over a set
of related concepts. Yet, this raises the question of
how to identify a context-appropriate concept for a
word from the distributional set of candidate concepts. For instance, apple in the context of “an apple is good for you health” tends to be associated
with the concept of fruit instead of company. Formally, given a word x; in a training sentence, a set
of k concept candidates, C; = {c},c?,--» , cf}, is
linked to the word from the knowledge base, with
distributional probabilities over the concepts, 1.e.,

represents the concept distribution over the inputs. Noted that, this distribution can be sparse since not every word
has its upper concept. Green bar represents the vocabulary distribution generated from seq2seq component.

P(C\2;) = {p(ct), p(c?),--- ,p(cf)}. The task
is to find the most suitable concept c} to fit the
updated context, represented by the vector h; in
Equation (2), at each time step tf.

In the case of generating summaries given updated contexts, a weighted update of the distributional concept candidates needs to be performed.
In the model, the updated weight, denoted as (?,
is estimated by a softmax classifier that is jointly
conditioned on the hidden representation of the
word h;, the context vectors h;, and each of concept vectors:

8! = softmax(W ),[h;, h*, c’]) (3)

where j € [1,k], W), is a trainable parameter,
and c} is the vector of the jth concept candidate,
which is a representation of the input embeddings.

Together with the concept probability from the
existing knowledge base p(c}) and the updated
weights based on the contexts pe , a context-aware
conceptualized probability of jth concept for the

word xj, Pe 5s is finally estimated as

P£, = p(c}) + 8} (4)

where 7¥ is a tunable parameter. Theoretically, we
will end up with a number of k relevant concepts
for each word C; = {c},--+ ,c¥} with a probability distribution over the set, which is learned as
ry — {Pi " ea , Pf}.

3.2.2 Concept Pointer Generator

The basic pointer generator network contains two
sub-modules, one is the pointer network and the

other is the generation network. These two submodules jointly determine the probabilities of the
words in the final generated summary. The generation probability pgen for the generation network
(See et al., 2017) is learned by

Pgen = o(W) h; +W s+ W yYt-1 + been)
(5)
where o is a sigmoid function.

For the pointer network, our model consists of
a pointer to the source text and a further concept
pointer to the relevant concepts that have arisen
from the source content. These two separate pointers are calculated as follows. The first pointer is
taken based on the attention distribution a;,; over
the source text. The second concept pointer is operated over a concept distribution of the source text
that is scaled element-wise by the attention distribution.

To train the model, given the likelihood of each
concept in the current context, the updates could
be performed in two ways. In a hard assignment,
the concept that receives the highest score would
be selected for the update:

—

Pe = PS

| aremann a) Where a = arg max(6; ) (6)
where a is the index of maximized generated
weight based on the contexts, and P;, is obtained
by Eas. (4).

In random selection, each of the concept candidates could be trained randomly to update the
parameters:

Pe = Pf; ~ Pe (7)

2 random
where j represents the selected concept index.
Considering the above baseline generation network and both the pointer networks, our final output distribution is

Prnai(w) = Deen Procab\ Ww) “lh (1 _ Den)

where Pe can be updated by PF og max? OF
Pe The difference between these two

choices is demonstrated in the Experiments sec
tion.

3.3. Objective Learning
3.3.1 Basic MLE

The baseline objective is derived by maximizing the likelihood training for the seq2seq generation, given a reference summary y* =
{Yi,Yo.°°* >Y,,} for document x. The training objective is to minimize the negative loglikelihood of the target word sequence:
Lue = — of, log Plyflyt.-++ .yf1,@)

(9)

3.3.2 Evaluation based Reinforcement
Learning (RL)

Similar to Paulus et al. (2017), policy gradient
methods can directly optimize discrete target evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE. The basic idea is
to explore new sequences and compare them to the
best greedy baseline sequence. Once the baseline
sequence y, or sampled sequence y’, are generated, they are compared against the reference sequence y* to compute the rewards r(7) and r(y’*),
respectively. In the RL training stage, two separate output candidates at each time step are produced: y* is sampled from the probability distribution P(y?|y},--- ,y?_1,@) , and g is the baseline
output. The training objective is then to minimize
Lax = (r(i) ~ r(y) De log PUwilyis + yeas)
(10)

It is noteworthy that the samples y* are selected
from a wide range of vocabularies extended by all
the concept candidates. This strategy ensures that
the model learns to generate sequences with higher
rewards by better exploring a set of close concepts.

Thus, the combination of these two objectives
yield improved task-specific scores while catering a better language model: Leings = ALRt +
(1 — A)Luze, where 2 is a soft-switch between
the two objectives. The model is pre-trained with
MLE loss, then switch to the final loss.

3.3.3. Distant Supervision (DS) for Model
Adaption

Our intuition is that, if the summary-document
pairs are dissimilar to the testing set, the model
could be retrained to adapt to weaken the influence
of the dissimilarity on the final loss. The result
would be a training model that better fits the specific testing data. The challenge is that there are
no explicit supervision labels to indicate whether
the training set is close to the testing set, so a new
training paradigm is needed. In answer to this
need and also to provide end-to-end functionality in the model, we developed a simple approach
for labeling summary-document pairs by calculating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between
each training reference summary and a set of testing documents. In this way, the training pairs are
distantly-labelled for training the model.
Specifically, the representations of the reference summaries and the testing set are computed
by summing all the involved word embeddings.
Given a testing document x, where J € [1, N“]
and N“ is the size of the testing corpus, the vector
based representation of one document is at =

/

exp()>_, 9), where n/ is the number of document words involved. The reference summary is
represented by y* = exp(7, y;). We normalize these vectors through a softmax function
to cater for KL calculation. The model adaption

with the distant labels is defined as:

d

Lps = (1 - si So Dx (y*, £¢)) Le

(11)
where Dxz(.) indicates the KL divergence between y* and af and 7 is a constant parameter that is tuned via adaption to the testing set.
The divergences are averaged within the testing
set, which indicates the overall distances between
testing set and each of the reference summarydocument pairs. In this way, the samples in the
training corpus are distantly annotated as either
relevant or irrelevant for model adaption, noting
that the model is pre-trained with the MLE loss
before switching to distantly-supervised training.
4 Experiments

Datasets: To evaluate the effectiveness of our
proposed model, we conducted training and testing on two popular datasets. The first was the English Gigaword Fifth Edition corpus (Parker et al.,
2011). We replicated the pre-processing steps
in (Rush et al., 2015) to obtain the same training/testing data. After pre-processing, the corpus
contained about 3.8M sentence-summary pairs as
training set and 189K pairs as the development
set. Once pairs with empty titles were removed,
the testing set numbered 1951 pairs. The second
dataset, DUC2004, was only used for testing. This
dataset consists of 500 document-headline summary pairs, where each document is paired with
four reference summaries written by humans.

Evaluation Metrics: We used ROUGE (Lin,
2004) as the evaluation metric, which measures
the quality of a summary by computing the overlapping lexical elements between the candidate
summary and a reference summary. Following
previous practice, we assessed RG-1 (unigram),
RG-2 (bigram) and RG-L (longest common subsequence - LCS). Noted that the English Gigaword?
testing set contains references of different lengths,
while the DUC-2004 testing set fixes the summary length to 75 bytes.

Training Setups: We initialize word embeddings with 128-d vectors and fine-tune them during training. Concepts share the same embeddings
with the words. The vocabulary size was set to
150k for both the source and target text. The hidden state size was set to 256. The vocabulary
size 18 increased from around 602 to 2216 concepts w.r.t the different number (& = 1,--- ,5) of
concept candidates for each word. Note that the
generated concepts with UNKs were subsequently
deleted. Our code is available on https://
github.com/wprojectsn/codes, and the
vocabularies and candidate concepts are also included.

We trained our models on a single GTX TITAN GPU machine. We used the Adagrad optimizer with a batch size of 64 to minimize the loss.
The initial learning rate and the accumulator value
were set to 0.15 and 0.1, respectively. We used
gradient clipping with a maximum gradient norm
of 2. At the time of decoding, the summaries were

produced through a beam search of size 8. The
hyper-parameter settings were A = 0.99, y = 0.1,
m = 2.92 on DUC-2004 and z = 1.68 on Gigaword. We trained our concept pointer generator
for 450k iterations yielded the best performance,
then took the optimization using RL rewards for
RG-L at 95K iterations on DUC-2004 and at 50K
iterations on Gigaword. We took the distancesupervised training at 5K iterations on DUC-2004
and at 6.5K iterations on Gigaword.

Baselines: The following state-of-the-art baselines were used as comparators. ABS+ (Rush
et al., 2015) is a tuned ABS model with additional features. Luong-NMT (Luong et al., 2015)
is a two-layer LSTM encoder-decoder. RASElman (Chopra et al., 2016) is a convolution encoder and an Elman RNN decoder with attention. Seq2seq+att is two-layer BiLSTM encoder
and one-layer LSTM decoder equipped with attention. Ivt5k-Isent (Nallapati et al., 2016) uses
temporal attention to keep track of the past attentive weights of the decoder and restrains the repetition in later sequences. SEASS (Zhou et al.,
2017) includes an additional selective gate to control information flow from the encoder to the decoder. Pointer-generator (See et al., 2017) is
an integrated pointer network and seq2seq model.
We implemented this baseline without its coverage
mechanism since this is not our focus. Baseline
models also include two pointer-generator based
extensions (Guo et al., 2018; Lietal., 2018). CGU
(Lin et al., 2018) sets a convolutional gated unit
and self-attention for global encoding.

5 Results and Analysis

The following analysis focuses on investigating
whether our model is, first, able to generate abstract and new concepts, and, second, how the
overall quality performs against the baselines.

5.1 Quantitative Analysis

The results are presented in Table 1. We observe
that our model outperformed all the strong stateof-the-art models on both datasets in all metrics
except for RG-2 on Gigaword. In terms of the
pointer generator performance, the improvements
made by our concept pointer are statistically significant (p < 0.01) across all metrics.

rization models. Although generating longer summaries or less UNKs is not our focus, our model
still showed improvements in this regard (Table
2). We counted the number of UNKs and all
generated summary words and measured the proportions in both testing sets. The OOV percentages dropped from 4.02% to 1.12% on Gigaword
and from 2.08% to 0.23% on DUC-2004, which
demonstrates that our model is effective at alleviating OOV problems. This result also supports
the superior of the concept pointer over the baseline pointer generator. From the statistics, we
found that the summaries generated by our concept pointer averaged around 10.46 words, while
the pointer generator summaries averaged 10.28
words per summary on DUC-2004. This shows
the concept pointer is able to capture more salient
content by generating relatively longer summaries.

Abstractiveness: According to Chen and
Bansal (2018), abstractiveness scores are computed as the percentage of novel n-grams in

Table 3: Abstractiveness: percentage of novel n-grams

the generated summaries that are not included
in the source documents. As shown in Table
3, compared with human-written summaries
which receive the highest novelty in terms of
abstractiveness, our concept pointer generator
achieves closest performance with human-written
summaries against the baseline. This result
demonstrates a further advantage of our model
in producing new and abstract concepts. Our
model is designed to improve semantic relevance
and promote higher abstraction. More generated
summary examples can be found in Appendix B.

5.2 Analysis on Training Strategies

To evaluate the relative impact of each training
strategy with the model, we tested different combinations for comparison with each other and against
the baselines.

ferent number of concept candidates, i... k =
1,2,3,4,5, to for the context-aware conceptualization update strategy. Performance was fully
evaluated with the three ROUGE metrics as shown
in Figure 3. The results only vary slightly according to the number of concepts with the random selection strategy (Eq.(7)), as shown in Figure 3(a)
and 3(b). This indicates that a random strategy is
not very sensitive to the number of extracted topics. This is, in part, because the concept pointer
may or may not be able to point to the correct concepts from multiple candidates. While in Figure
3(c) and 3(d), the optimum settings are clearly apparent, 1.e., k = 1 on Gigaword and k = 2 on
DUC-2004. Overall, the hard assignment strategy
(Eq.(6)) provided the best performance in practical
terms, while random selection (Eq.(7)) performs
stably with different settings.

Training with DS vs. RL: As shown in Table 1, our model with either a distant supervision
strategy (concept pointer+DS) or reinforcement
learning (concept pointer+RL) were both superior to the basic concept pointer generator on both
datasets. Further, the relative improvement of the
concept pointer+DS over the concept pointer+RL
ranged from 3.5% to 9.6% on DUC-2004 but was
inferior to concept pointer+RL on Gigaword. In
comparing the results, it is clear that DS training

has a noticeable effect when the testing set is substantially semantically different from the training
set but provides less improvement than RL when
the two are close. From this analysis, we conclude
that the DS strategy is better for model adaption
with abstractive summarization.

5.3. Human Evaluations

To explore the correctness of our model using human judgment, we conducted a manual evaluation with 20 post-graduate volunteers. We primarily used the following criteria to assess the generated summaries: abstraction, i1.e., Are the abstract
concepts contained in the summary appropriate?;
and overall quality, i.e., Is the summary readable,
informative, relevant, etc.? To conduct the evaluation, we randomly selected 20 examples from
the DUC 2004 testing set and asked the volunteers to subjectively assess the summaries. Each
example consisted of an article and three summaries, 1.e., a summary by the seq2seq model, the
pointer generator model, and our proposed concept pointer model. The volunteers chose the best
summaries for each of the articles according to
the above criteria (can be multiple choices). Obviously, the summaries were randomly shuffled,
and the model used to produce each was unknown
to prevent bias. The scores for each model were
ranked by how many times the volunteers chose a
summary w.r.t each criteria, averaged by the number of participants. The results are presented in
Table 4, which show that our model outperformed
both the seq2seq model and the pointer generator
(See et al., 2017) in both criteria.

As a last step, we manually inspect the summaries generated by our model, and some examples are presented in Appendix B. We found that
the summaries were not as abstract as humanwritten summary would likely be. The overarching tendency of the model is still to copy segments
of the source text and rearrange the phrases into
a summary. However, the overall approach does
produce more high-level concepts with correct relations compared to the baselines, which demonstrates that our solution is a promising research direction to further pursue. Additionally, the generated summaries are long, fluent, and informative.

6 Conclusion

This paper presents a novel concept pointer generator model to improve the abstractive summarization model and generate concept-oriented summaries. We also propose a novel distant supervision strategy for model adaption to different
datasets. Both empirical and subjective experiments show that our model makes a statistically
significant quality improvement over the state-ofthe-art baselines on two popular datasets.
