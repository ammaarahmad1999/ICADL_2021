(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||extend||traditional training method)
(traditional training method||with||novel approach)
(novel approach||called||dynamic - critical reinforcement learning)
(dynamic - critical reinforcement learning||dynamically decides||reward and the baseline)
(reward and the baseline||according to||two sampling strategies)
(Model||has||reattention)
(reattention||be||more concentrated)
(more concentrated||if||past attentions)
(past attentions||focus on||same parts)
(same parts||of||input)
(reattention||be||relatively more distracted)
(relatively more distracted||to focus on||new regions)
(new regions||if||past attentions)
(past attentions||are||not overlapped at all)
(Model||has||computation)
(computation||based on||two words)
(two words||share||similar semantics)
(two words||if||attentions)
(attentions||about||same texts)
(same texts||be||less similar)
(same texts||are||highly overlapped)
(Model||present||reattention mechanism)
(reattention mechanism||that||temporally memorizes)
(temporally memorizes||has||past attentions)
(past attentions||to refine||current attentions)
(current attentions||in||multi-round alignment architecture)
