(Contribution||has||Ablation analysis)
(Ablation analysis||using||1 - layer fusion block)
(1 - layer fusion block||leads to||obvious performance loss)
(obvious performance loss||implies||significance)
(significance||of||performing)
(performing||has||multi-hop reasoning)
(multi-hop reasoning||in||Hotpot QA)
(Ablation analysis||of||QA performances)
(QA performances||in||development set)
(development set||of||Hotpot QA)
(development set||see that||each of our model components)
(each of our model components||provide||from 1 % to 2 %)
(from 1 % to 2 %||has||relative gain)
(relative gain||over||QA performance)
(Ablation analysis||has||dataset abla-tion results)
(dataset abla-tion results||show||our model)
(our model||has||not very sensitive)
(not very sensitive||can achieve||more than 5 % performance gain)
(more than 5 % performance gain||in||gold paragraphs only)
(more than 5 % performance gain||in||supporting facts only)
(not very sensitive||to||noisy paragraphs)
(not very sensitive||comparing with||baseline model)
