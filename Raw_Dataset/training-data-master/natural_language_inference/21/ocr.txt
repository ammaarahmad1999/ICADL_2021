Abstract

Recurrent neural nets (RNN) and convolutional neural nets
(CNN) are widely used on NLP tasks to capture the long-term
and local dependencies, respectively. Attention mechanisms
have recently attracted enormous interest due to their highly
parallelizable computation, significantly less training time,
and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel
attention mechanism in which the attention between elements
from input sequence(s) is directional and multi-dimensional
(i.e., feature-wise). A light-weight neural net, “Directional
Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)”’, is then proposed to learn
sentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention
without any RNN/CNN structure. DiSAN is only composed
of a directional self-attention with temporal order encoded,
followed by a multi-dimensional attention that compresses
the sequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple
form, DiSAN outperforms complicated RNN models on both
prediction quality and time efficiency. It achieves the best
test accuracy among all sentence encoding methods and improves the most recent best result by 1.02% on the Stanford
Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, and shows stateof-the-art test accuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank
(SST), Multi-Genre natural language inference (MultiNL]D,
Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK), Customer Review, MPQA, TREC question-type classification
and Subjectivity (SUBJ) datasets.

1 Introduction

Context dependency plays a significant role in language
understanding and provides critical information to natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. For different tasks and
data, researchers often switch between two types of deep
neural network (DNN): recurrent neural network (RNN)
with sequential architecture capturing long-range dependencies (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber 1997) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Chung
et al. 2014)), and convolutional neural network (CNN) (Kim
2014) whose hierarchical structure is good at extracting local or position-invariant features. However, which network
to choose in practice is an open question, and the choice relies largely on the empirical knowledge.

Recent works have found that equipping RNN or CNN
with an attention mechanism can achieve state-of-the-art

performance on a large number of NLP tasks, including neural machine translation (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015;
Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015), natural language inference (Liu et al. 2016), conversation generation (Shang, Lu,
and Li 2015), question answering (Hermann et al. 2015;
Sukhbaatar et al. 2015), machine reading comprehension
(Seo et al. 2017), and sentiment analysis (Kokkinos and
Potamianos 2017). The attention uses a hidden layer to compute a categorical distribution over elements from the input sequence to reflect their importance weights. It allows
RNN/CNN to maintain a variable-length memory, so that
elements from the input sequence can be selected by their
importance/relevance and merged into the output. In contrast to RNN and CNN, the attention mechanism is trained
to capture the dependencies that make significant contributions to the task, regardless of the distance between the elements in the sequence. It can thus provide complementary
information to the distance-aware dependencies modeled by
RNN/CNN. In addition, computing attention only requires
matrix multiplication, which is highly parallelizable compared to the sequential computation of RNN.

In a very recent work (Vaswani et al. 2017), an attention mechanism is solely used to construct a sequence to
sequence (seq2seq) model that achieves a state-of-the-art
quality score on the neural machine translation (NMT) task.
The seq2seq model, ““Transformer’”’, has an encoder-decoder
structure that is only composed of stacked attention networks, without using either recurrence or convolution. The
proposed attention, “multi-head attention’, projects the input sequence to multiple subspaces, then applies scaled dotproduct attention to its representation in each subspace,
and lastly concatenates their output. By doing this, it can
combine different attentions from multiple subspaces. This
mechanism is used in Transformer to compute both the
context-aware features inside the encoder/decoder and the
bottleneck features between them.

The attention mechanism has more flexibility in sequence
length than RNN/CNN, and is more task/data-driven when
modeling dependencies. Unlike sequential models, its computation can be easily and significantly accelerated by existing distributed/parallel computing schemes. However, to the
best of our knowledge, a neural net entirely based on attention has not been designed for other NLP tasks except NMT,
especially those that cannot be cast into a seq2seq problem.
Compared to RNN, a disadvantage of most attention mechanisms is that the temporal order information is lost, which
however might be important to the task. This explains why
positional encoding is applied to the sequence before being
processed by the attention in Transformer. How to model order information within an attention is still an open problem.

The goal of this paper is to develop a unified and
RNN/CNN-free attention network that can be generally utilized to learn the sentence encoding model for different NLP
tasks, such as natural language inference, sentiment analysis, sentence classification and semantic relatedness. We focus on the sentence encoding model because it is a basic
module of most DNNs used in the NLP literature.

We propose a novel attention mechanism that differs from
previous ones in that it is 1) multi-dimensional: the attention w.r.t. each pair of elements from the source(s) is a vector, where each entry is the attention computed on each feature; and 2) directional: it uses one or multiple positional
masks to model the asymmetric attention between two elements. We compute feature-wise attention since each element in a sequence is usually represented by a vector, e.g.,
word/character embedding (Kim et al. 2016), and attention
on different features can contain different information about
dependency, thus to handle the variation of contexts around
the same word. We apply positional masks to attention distribution since they can easily encode prior structure know]ledge such as temporal order and dependency parsing. This
design mitigates the weakness of attention in modeling order
information, and takes full advantage of parallel computing.

We then build a light-weight and RNN/CNN-free neural
network, “Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)”,
for sentence encoding. This network relies entirely on the
proposed attentions and does not use any RNN/CNN structure. In DiSAN, the input sequence is processed by directional (forward and backward) self-attentions to model context dependency and produce context-aware representations
for all tokens. Then, a multi-dimensional attention computes
a vector representation of the entire sequence, which can
be passed into a classification/regression module to compute the final prediction for a particular task. Unlike Transformer, neither stacking of attention blocks nor an encoderdecoder structure is required. The simple architecture of
DiSAN leads to fewer parameters, less computation and easier parallelization.

In experiments!, we compare DiSAN with the currently
popular methods on various NLP tasks, e.g., natural language inference, sentiment analysis, sentence classification,
etc. DiSAN achieves the highest test accuracy on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset among
sentence-encoding models and improves the currently best
result by 1.02%. It also shows the state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), MultiGenre natural language inference (MultiNLI), SICK, Customer Review, MPQA, SUBJ and TREC question-type classification datasets. Meanwhile, it has fewer parameters and
exhibits much higher computation efficiency than the mod

2 Background
2.1 Sentence Encoding

In the pipeline of NLP tasks, a sentence is denoted by a sequence of discrete tokens (e.g., words or characters) v =
[v1,V2,;---,;Un], Where vu; could be a one-hot vector whose
dimension length equals the number of distinct tokens N.
A pre-trained token embedding (e.g., word2vec (Mikolov
et al. 2013b) or GloVe (Pennington, Socher, and Manning
2014)) is applied to vw and transforms all discrete tokens to
a sequence of low-dimensional dense vector representations
x = [%1,%2,...,2y| with 2; € R%. This pre-process can
be written as «2 = W°)v, where word embedding weight
matrix W) € R4*N anda € R4e*”,

Most DNN sentence-encoding models for NLP tasks take
x as the input and further generate a vector representation u;
for each x; by context fusion. Then a sentence encoding is
obtained by mapping the sequence wu = [uw 1, U2,..., Un] to
a single vector s € IR?, which is used as a compact encoding
of the entire sentence in NLP problems.

2.2 Attention

The attention is proposed to compute an alignment score between elements from two sources. In particular, given the token embeddings of a source sequence x = [271,%2,...,%n|
and the vector representation of a query q, attention computes the alignment score between x; and q by a compatibility function f(;,q), which measures the dependency between x; and q, or the attention of g to x;. A softmax function then transforms the scores | f(a;, q)|"_, to a probability
distribution p(z|a,q) by normalizing over all the n tokens
of x. Here z is an indicator of which token in x is important
to qg on a specific task. That is, large p(z = i|a, q) means x;
contributes important information to g. The above process
can be summarized by the following equations.

a= Lf (va, Qj ; (1)
p(z|x, q) = softmax(a). (2)

Specifically,

drini CxP(S (xi, q))
The output of this attention mechanism is a weighted sum
of the embeddings for all tokens in x, where the weights
are given by p(z|a, q). It places large weights on the tokens
important to g, and can be written as the expectation of a
token sampled according to its importance, 1.e.,

a= S_ rz — ila, q) x4 — Rgnopt x larg) (x3), (4)
1=1

where s € R% can be used as the sentence encoding of x.

2015) and multiplicative attention (or dot-product attention)
(Vaswani et al. 2017; Sukhbaatar et al. 2015; Rush, Chopra,
and Weston 2015) are the two most commonly used attention mechanisms. They share the same and unified form of
attention introduced above, but are different in the compatibility function f(x;, q). Additive attention is associated with

f(ai,g =wio(WMa; +Wq), (5)

where o(-) is an activation function and w € R“ is a weight
vector. Multiplicative attention uses inner product or cosine
similarity for f(2;,q), ie.,

f(ai.g) = (WOx,,Wq). (6)

In practice, additive attention often outperforms multiplicative one in prediction quality, but the latter is faster and more
memory-efficient due to optimized matrix multiplication.

2.3 Self-Attention

Self-Attention is a special case of the attention mechanism
introduced above. It replaces q with a token embedding 7;
from the source input itself. It relates elements at different
positions from a single sequence by computing the attention
between each pair of tokens, x; and z;. It is very expressive and flexible for both long-range and local dependencies, which used to be respectively modeled by RNN and
CNN. Moreover, it has much faster computation speed and
fewer parameters than RNN. In recent works, we have already witnessed its success across a variety of NLP tasks,
such as reading comprehension (Hu, Peng, and Qiu 2017)
and neural machine translation (Vaswani et al. 2017).

3 Two Proposed Attention Mechanisms

In this section, we introduce two novel attention mechanisms, multi-dimensional attention in Section 3.1 (with two
extensions to self-attention in Section 3.2) and directional
self-attention in Section 3.3. They are the main components
of DiSAN and may be of independent interest to other neural
nets for other NLP problems in which an attention is needed.

3.1 Miulti-dimensional Attention

Multi-dimensional attention is a natural extension of additive attention (or MLP attention) at the feature level. Instead
of computing a single scalar score f(x;, q) for each token x;
as shown in Eq.(5), multi-dimensional attention computes a
feature-wise score vector for x; by replacing weight vector
w in Eq.(5) with a matrix W, Le.,

f(vig) =Wlo (Wai +Wq), 7

where f(2x;,q) € R% is a vector with the same length as 2;,
and all the weight matrices W, WW‘), W() © RdeX4e, We
further add two bias terms to the parts in and out activation
o(-), ie.,

fig) =Wlo (WYa;+Wq+oM) +b. @)

We then compute a categorical distribution p(z;,|a, q) over
all the n tokens for each feature k € [d.]. A large p(z, =
i|x,q) means that feature k of token 7 is important to q.

We apply the same procedure Eq.(1)-(3) in traditional attention to the k*” dimension of f(a;,q). In particular, for
each feature k € [d.|, we replace f(x;,q) with [f(2;,q)|x,
and change z to z, in Eq.(1)-(3). Now each feature & in each
token i has an importance weight P,; = p(z, = i|x, q). The
output s can be written as

n de de
s= [So Pete’) = Ennerie tn) ©

We give an illustration of traditional attention and multidimensional attention in Figure 1. In the rest of this paper,
we will ignore the subscript & which indexes feature dimension for simplification if no confusion is possible. Hence,
the output s can be written as an element-wise product
5 = izt Pj © Ly

Remark: The word embedding usually suffers from the
polysemy in natural language. Since traditional attention
computes a single importance score for each word based on
the word embedding, it cannot distinguish the meanings of
the same word in different contexts. Multi-dimensional attention, however, computes a score for each feature of each
word, so it can select the features that can best describe the
word’s specific meaning in any given context, and include
this information in the sentence encoding output s.

3.2 Two types of Multi-dimensional Self-attention

When extending multi-dimension to self-attentions, we have
two variants of multi-dimensional attention. The first one,
called multi-dimensional “token2token” self-attention, explores the dependency between x; and x; from the same
source x, and generates context-aware coding for each element. It replaces q with x; in Eq.(8), Le.,

f(aj;,2;) =Wlo (WY 2, +W x; +b ) +b. (10)
J J

Similar to P in vanilla multi-dimensional attention, we compute a probability matrix P? € R@*” for each x; Such that

Pi. = p(z, = |x, x;). The output for x; is

Here, we use 1; ; to denote f(h;, h;) in Eq. (15).

The output of token2token self-attention for all elements
from x is s = [s1, S2,..., 5] € R%&*”.

The second one, multi-dimensional “source2token” selfattention, explores the dependency between x; and the entire
sequence x, and compresses the sequence 2 into a vector. It
removes g from Eq.(8), 1.e.,

f(a) =WTo (Wa; +b) +0. (12)

The probability matrix is defined as Py; = plz, = i\ax)
and is computed in the same way as FP in vanilla multidimensional attention. The output s is also same, 1.e.,

s=) Pi O2; (13)
4I=l

We will use these two types (1.e., token2token and
source2token) of multi-dimensional self-attention in different parts of our sentence encoding model, DiSAN.

3.3 Directional Self-Attention

Directional self-attention (DiSA) is composed of a fully
connected layer whose input is the token embeddings 2,
a “masked” multi-dimensional token2token self-attention
block to explore the dependency and temporal order, and a
fusion gate to combine the output and input of the attention
block. Its structure is shown in Figure 2. It can be used as
either a neural net or a module to compose a large network.

In DiSA, we first transform the input sequence x =
[v1,%2,.--,2n] to a sequence of hidden state h =
[hi, ha,..., hn] by a fully connected layer, i.e.,

h =o, (Wa + bi") ) . (14)

where x € R¢e*", h © R&n*”, W) and b™ are the learnable parameters, and o;,(-) is an activation function.

We then apply multi-dimensional token2token selfattention to h, and generate context-aware vector representations s for all elements from the input sequence. We make
two modifications to Eq.(10) to reduce the number of parameters and make the attention directional.

First, we set W in Eq.(10) to a scalar c and divide the part
in o(-) by c, and we use tanh(-) for o(-), which reduces the
number of parameters. In experiments, we always set c = 5,
and obtain stable output.

Second, we apply a positional mask to Eq.(10), so the attention between two elements can be asymmetric. Given a
mask M € {0,—oco}"*", we set bias b to a constant vector M;;1 in Eq.(10), where 1 is an all-one vector. Hence,
Eq.(10) is modified to

f (hi, hj) —
c- tanh (Wn, +Why + b/c) +Mj;1. (15)

To see why a mask can encode directional information, let

us consider a case in which M;; = —oo and M,; = 0, which
results in |f(h;,h;)|, = —oo and unchanged [f(h,;, hi)|x.
Since the probability p(z, = %|a,x,;) is computed by

softmax, |f(hi,h;)|_ = —oo leads to p(z, = t|x,x;) = 0.
This means that there is no attention of x; to x; on feature k.
On the contrary, we have p(z, = j|a,x;) > 0, which means
that attention of x; to x; exists on feature k. Therefore, prior
structure knowledge such as temporal order and dependency
parsing can be easily encoded by the mask, and explored in
generating sentence encoding. This is an important feature
of DiSA that previous attention mechanisms do not have.

For self-attention, we usually need to disable the attention
of each token to itself (Hu, Peng, and Qiu 2017). This is the
same as applying a diagonal-disabled (1.e., diag-disabled)
mask such that

diag __ 0, a x j
Mi; a” _ i= 7 (16)

Moreover, we can use masks to encode temporal order
information into attention output. In this paper, we use two
masks, i.e., forward mask Mf“ and backward mask M”,

fw 0, w< j

Mi = = otherwise qd”)
bw __ 0, > j

Miz = = otherwise (18)

In forward mask M/’, there is the only attention of later
token 7 to early token 2, and vice versa in backward mask.
We show these three positional masks in Figure 3.

Given input sequence x and a mask M/, we compute
f (a, %;) according to Eq.(15), and follow the standard procedure of multi-dimensional token2token self-attention to

compute the probability matrix P/ for each 7 € [n]. Each
output s; in s is computed as in Eq.(11).

The final output u € R%*” of DiSA is obtained by combining the output s and the input h of the masked multidimensional token2token self-attention block. This yields a
temporal order encoded and context-aware vector representation for each element/token. The combination is accomplished by a dimension-wise fusion gate, 1.e.,

F = sigmoid (Wis + WDA + oF ) (19)
u=FOh+(1-F)os (20)

where WFD) WF?) © RanXdn and bY) E€ R are the
learnable parameters of the fusion gate.

4 Directional Self-Attention Network

We propose a light-weight network, “Directional SelfAttention Network (DiSAN)”, for sentence encoding. Its architecture is shown in Figure 4.

Given an input sequence of token embedding x, DiSAN
firstly applies two parameter-untied DiSA blocks with forward mask Mf’ Eg.(17) and M°” Eq.(18), respectively.
The feed-forward procedure is given in Eq.(14)-(15) and
Eq.(19)-(20). Their outputs are denoted by uf”, ue’ €
IR?*", We concatenate them vertically as [uf”;u’] €
R24" and use this concatenated output as input to a multidimensional source2token self-attention block, whose output s%82” © JR24n computed by Eq.(12)-(13) is the final
sentence encoding result of DiSAN.

Remark: In DiSAN, forward/backward DiSA blocks
work as context fusion layers. And the multi-dimensional
source2token self-attention compresses the sequence into a

single vector. The idea of using both forward and backward
attentions is inspired by Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
(Graves, Jaitly, and Mohamed 2013), in which forward and
backward LSTMs are used to encode long-range dependency from different directions. In Bi-LSTM, LSTM combines the context-aware output with the input by multi-gate.
The fusion gate used in DiSA shares the similar motivation.
However, DiSAN has fewer parameters, simpler structure
and better efficiency.

5 Experiments

In this section, we first apply DiSAN to natural language
inference and sentiment analysis tasks. DiSAN achieves
the state-of-the-art performance and significantly better efficiency than other baseline methods on benchmark datasets
for both tasks. We also conduct experiments on other NLP
tasks and DiSAN also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Training Setup: We use cross-entropy loss plus L2 regularization penalty as optimization objective. We minimize
it by Adadelta (Zeiler 2012) (an optimizer of mini-batch
SGD) with batch size of 64. We use Adadelta rather than
Adam (Kingma and Ba 2015) because in our experiments,
DiSAN optimized by Adadelta can achieve more stable performance than Adam optimized one. Initial learning rate is
set to 0.5. All weight matrices are initialized by Glorot Initialization (Glorot and Bengio 2010), and the biases are initialized with 0. We initialize the word embedding in x by
300D GloVe 6B pre-trained vectors (Pennington, Socher,
and Manning 2014). The Out-of-Vocabulary words in training set are randomly initialized by uniform distribution between (—0.05,0.05). The word embeddings are fine-tuned
during the training phrase. We use Dropout (Srivastava et
al. 2014) with keep probability 0.75 for language inference
and 0.8 for sentiment analysis. The L2 regularization decay factors 7 are 5 x 10~° and 10~* for language inference
and sentiment analysis, respectively. Note that the dropout
keep probability and + varies with the scale of corresponding dataset. Hidden units number dy, is set to 300. Activation functions o(-) are ELU (exponential linear unit) (Clevert, Unterthiner, and Hochreiter 2016) if not specified. All
models are implemented with TensorFlow’ and run on sin

5.1 Natural Language Inference

The goal of Natural Language Inference (NLI) is to reason the semantic relationship between a premise sentence
and a corresponding hypothesis sentence. The possible relationship could be entailment, neutral or contradiction. We
compare different models on a widely used benchmark,
Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI?* (Bowman et
al. 2015) dataset, which consists of 549,367/9,842/9,824
(train/dev/test) premise-hypothesis pairs with labels.

Following the standard procedure in Bowman et al.
(2016), we launch two sentence encoding models (e.g.,
DiSAN) with tied parameters for the premise sentence and
hypothesis sentence, respectively. Given the output encoding
s? for the premise and s” for the hypothesis, the representation of relationship is the concatenation of s?, s”, s? — s!
and s? © s”, which is fed into a 300D fully connected layer
and then a 3-unit output layer with softmax to compute a
probability distribution over the three types of relationship.

For thorough comparison, besides the neural nets proposed in previous works of NLI, we implement five extra
neural net baselines to compare with DiSAN. They help
us to analyze the improvement contributed by each part of
DiSAN and to verify that the two attention mechanisms proposed in Section 3 can improve other networks.

with source2token self-attention. The positional encoding

*https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/

method used in Vaswani et al. (2017) is applied to the input sequence to encode temporal information. We find our
experiments show that multi-head attention is sensitive to
hyperparameters, so we adjust keep probability of dropout
from 0.7 to 0.9 with step 0.05 and report the best result.

e Bi-LSTM with s2t self-attention: a multi-dimensional
source2token self-attention block is applied to the output
of Bi-LSTM (300D forward + 300D backward LSTMs).

e DiSAN without directions: DiSAN with the forward/backward masks M/” and M°” replaced with two
diag-disabled masks M diag ie. DiSAN without forward/backward order information.

Compared to the results from the official leaderboard
of SNLI in Table 1, DiSAN outperforms previous works
and improves the best latest test accuracy (achieved by a
memory-based NSE encoder network) by a remarkable margin of 1.02%. DiSAN surpasses the RNN/CNN based models with more complicated architecture and more parameters
by large margins, e.g., +2.32% to Bi-LSTM, +1.42% to BiLSTM with additive attention. It even outperforms models
with the assistance of a semantic parsing tree, e.g., +3.52%
to Tree-based CNN, +2.42% to SPINN-PI.

In the results of the five baseline methods and DiSAN at
the bottom of Table 1, we demonstrate that making attention
multi-dimensional (feature-wise) or directional brings substantial improvement to different neural nets. First, a comparison between the first two models shows that changing
token-wise attention to multi-dimensional/feature-wise attention leads to 3.31% improvement on a word embedding
based model. Also, a comparison between the third baseline
and DiSAN shows that DiSAN can substantially outperform
multi-head attention by 1.45%. Moreover, a comparison between the forth baseline and DiSAN shows that the DiSA
block can even outperform Bi-LSTM layer in context encoding, improving test accuracy by 0.64%. A comparison
between the fifth baseline and DiSAN shows that directional
self-attention with forward and backward masks (with temporal order encoded) can bring 0.96% improvement.

Additional advantages of DiSAN shown in Table 1 are
its fewer parameters and compelling time efficiency. It is
x3 faster than widely used Bi-LSTM model. Compared to
other models with competitive performance, e.g., 600D BiLSTM encoders with intra-attention (2.8M), 300D NSE encoders (3.0M) and 600D Bi-LSTM encoders with multidimensional attention (2.88M), DiSAN only has 2.35M parameters.

Table 2: Test accuracy of fine-grained sentiment analysis on
Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset.

Sentiment analysis aims to analyze the sentiment of a
sentence or a paragraph, e.g., a movie or a product review. We use Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)* (Socher
et al. 2013) for the experiments, and only focus on the
fine-grained movie review sentiment classification over five
classes, 1.e., very negative, negative, neutral, positive and
very positive. We use the standard train/dev/test sets split
with 8,544/1,101/2,210 samples. Similar to Section 5.1, we
employ a single sentence encoding model to obtain a sentence representation s of a movie review, then pass it into
a 300D fully connected layer. Finally, a 5-unit output layer
with softmax is used to calculate a probability distribution
over the five classes.

In Table 2, we compare previous works with DiSAN on
test accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, DiSAN improves the last best accuracy (given by CNN-Tensor) by
0.52%. Compared to tree-based models with heavy use of
the prior structure, e.g., MV-RNN, RNTN and Tree-LSTM,
DiSAN outperforms them by 7.32%, 6.02% and 0.72%,
respectively. Additionally, DiSAN achieves better performance than CNN-based models. More recent works tend
to focus on lexicon-based sentiment analysis, by exploring sentiment lexicons, negation words and intensity words.

Nonetheless, DiSAN still outperforms these fancy models,
such as NCSL (+0.62%) and LR-Bi-LSTM (+1.12%).

Sentence Length

Figure 5: Fine-grained sentiment analysis accuracy vs. sentence length. The results of LSTM, Bi-LSTM and TreeLSTM are from Tai, Socher, and Manning (2015) and the
result of DiSAN is the average over five random trials.

It is also interesting to see the performance of different
models on the sentences with different lengths. In Figure 5,
we compare LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Tree-LSTM and DiSAN on
different sentence lengths. In the range of (5, 12), the length
range for most movie review sentences, DiSAN significantly
outperforms others. Meanwhile, DiSAN also shows impressive performance for slightly longer sentences or paragraphs
in the range of (25,38). DiSAN performs poorly when the
sentence length > 38, in which however only 3.21% of total
movie review sentences lie.

5.3. Experiments on Other NLP Tasks

Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Multi-Genre
Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)°> (Williams, Nangia, and Bowman 2017) dataset consists of 433k sentence
pairs annotated with textual entailment information. This
dataset is similar to SNLI, but it covers more genres of spoken and written text, and supports a distinctive cross-genre
generalization evaluation. However, MultiNLI is a quite new
dataset, and its leaderboard does not include a session for
the sentence-encoding only model. Hence, we only compare
DiSAN with the baselines provided at the official website.
The results of DiSAN and two sentence-encoding models
on the leaderboard are shown in Table 3. Note that the prediction accuracies of Matched and Mismatched test datasets
are obtained by submitting our test results to Kaggle open
evaluation platforms®: MultiNLI Matched Open Evaluation
and MultiNLI Mismatched Open Evaluation.

Semantic Relatedness The task of semantic relatedness
aims to predict a similarity degree of a given pair of sentences. We show an experimental comparison of different

Sentence Classifications The goal of sentence classification is to correctly predict the class label of a given sentence
in various scenarios. We evaluate the models on four sentence classification benchmarks of various NLP tasks, such
as sentiment analysis and question-type classification. They
are listed as follows. 1) CR: Customer review (Hu and Liu
2004) of various products (cameras, etc.), which is to predict whether the review is positive or negative; 2) MPQA:
Opinion polarity detection subtask of the MPQA dataset
(Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie 2005); 3) SUBJ: Subjectivity
dataset (Pang and Lee 2004) whose labels indicate whether
each sentence is subjective or objective; 4) TREC: TREC
question-type classification dataset (Li and Roth 2002). The
experimental results of DiSAN and existing methods are
shown in Table 5.

5.4 Case Study

To gain a closer view of what dependencies in a sentence
can be captured by DiSAN, we visualize the attention probability p(z = i|x,x,;) or alignment score by heatmaps. In

particular, we will focus primarily on the probability in forward/backward DiSA blocks (Figure 6), forward/backward
fusion gates F’ in Eq.(19) (Figure 7), and the probability
in multi-dimensional source2token self-attention block (Figure 8). For the first two, we desire to demonstrate the dependency at token level, but attention probability in DiSAN
is defined on each feature, so we average the probabilities
along the feature dimension.

We select two sentences from SNLI test set as examples
for this case study. Sentence | is Families have some dogs
in front of a carousel and sentence 2 is volleyball match is in
progress between ladies.

Figure 6: Attention probability in forward/backward DiSA
blocks for the two example sentences.
Figure 6 shows that1) semantically important words such
as nouns and verbs usually get large attention, but stop
words (am, is, are, etc.) do not; 2) globally important words,
e.g., volleyball, match, ladies in sentence 1 and dog, front,
carousel in sentence 2, get large attention from all other
words; 3) if a word is important to only some of the other
words (e.g. to constitute a phrase or sense-group), it gets
large attention only from these words, e.g., attention between progress, between in sentence 1, and attention between
families, have in sentence 2.

This also shows that directional information can help to
generate context-aware word representation with temporal
order encoded. For instance, for word match in sentence 1,
its forward DiSA focuses more on word volleyball, while
its backward attention focuses more on progress and ladies,
so the representation of word match contains the essential
information of the entire sentence, and simultaneously includes the positional order information.

In addition, forward and backward DiSAs can focus on
different parts of a sentence. For example, the forward one
in sentence 2 pays attention to the word families, whereas the
backward one focuses on the word carousel. Since forward
and backward attentions are computed separately, it avoids
normalization over multiple significant words to weaken
their weights. Note that this is a weakness of traditional attention compared to RNN, especially for long sentences.

Figure 7: Fusion Gate F’ in forward/backward DiSA blocks.

In Figure 7, we show that the gate value F’ in Eq.(19). The
gate combines the input and output of masked self-attention.
It tends to selects the input representation A instead of the
output s if the corresponding weight in F’ is large. This
shows that the gate values for meaningless words, especially
stop words is small. The stop words themselves cannot contribute important information, so only their semantic relations to other words might help to understand the sentence.
Hence, the gate tends to use their context features given by
masked self-attention.

Figure 8: Two pairs of attention probability comparison of
same word in difference sentence contexts.

In Figure 8, we show the two multi-dimensional
source2token self-attention score vectors of the same word
in the two sentences, by their heatmaps. The first pair has
two sentences: one is The glass bottle is big, and another is
A man is pouring a glass of tea. They share the same word is
glass with different meanings. The second pair has two sentences: one is The restaurant is about to close and another
is A biker is close to the fountain. It can be seen that the
two attention vectors for the same words are very different
due to their different meanings in different contexts. This
indicates that the multi-dimensional attention vector is not
redundant because it can encode more information than one
single score used in traditional attention and it is able to capture subtle difference of the same word in different contexts
or sentences. Additionally, it can also alleviate the weakness
of the attention over long sequence, which can avoid normalization over entire sequence in traditional attention only
once.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose two novel attention mechanisms,
multi-dimensional attention and directional self-attention.
The multi-dimensional attention performs a feature-wise selection over the input sequence for a specific task, and the
directional self-attention uses the positional masks to produce the context-aware representations with temporal information encoded. Based on these attentions, Directional
Self-Attention Network (DiSAN) is proposed for sentenceencoding without any recurrent or convolutional structure.
The experiment results show that DiSAN can achieve stateof-the-art inference quality and outperform existing works
(LSTM, etc.) on a wide range of NLP tasks with fewer parameters and higher time efficiency.

In future work, we will explore the approaches to using
the proposed attention mechanisms on more sophisticated
tasks, e.g. question answering and reading comprehension,
to achieve better performance on various benchmarks.
