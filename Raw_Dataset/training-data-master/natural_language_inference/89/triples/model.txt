(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||augment||existing readers)
(existing readers||with||two auxiliary losses)
(Model||leverage||multi-head pointer network)
(multi-head pointer network||to generate||two pairs of span scores)
(two pairs of span scores||where||other)
(other||used for||auxiliary loss)
(two pairs of span scores||where||one pair)
(one pair||is||normalized)
(normalized||with||no -answer score)
(Model||introduce||additional answer verifying phase)
(additional answer verifying phase||aims at||finding)
(finding||has||local entailment)
(local entailment||supports||answer)
(Model||introducing||independent span loss)
(independent span loss||aims to||concentrate)
(concentrate||on||answer extraction task)
(Model||has||our system)
(our system||consists of||two components)
(two components||has||no-answer reader)
(no-answer reader||for extracting||candidate answers)
(no-answer reader||detecting||unanswerable questions)
(two components||has||answer verifier)
(answer verifier||for deciding||extracted candidate)
(extracted candidate||is||legitimate)
(Model||investigate||three different architectures)
(three different architectures||for||answer verifying task)
(three different architectures||has||first one)
(first one||is||sequential model)
(sequential model||takes||two sentences)
(two sentences||as||along sequence)
(three different architectures||has||second one)
(second one||capture||interactions)
(interactions||between||two sentences)
(three different architectures||has||last one)
(last one||is||hybrid model)
(hybrid model||that combines||above two models)
(Model||present||another independent noanswer loss)
(another independent noanswer loss||to further alleviate||confliction)
(another independent noanswer loss||focusing on||no-answer detection task)
(no-answer detection task||without||shared normalization)
(shared normalization||of||answer extraction)
(Model||propose||read - then - verify system)
(read - then - verify system||aims to be||robust)
(robust||to||unanswerable questions)
