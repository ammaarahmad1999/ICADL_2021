(Model||setting of||simple QA)
(simple QA||corresponds to||elementary operation)
(elementary operation||of performing||single lookup)
(single lookup||in||memory)
(Model||has||Memory Networks)
(Memory Networks||are||learning systems)
(learning systems||focus on cases where||relationship)
(relationship||performed by||embedding)
(embedding||in||same vector space)
(embedding||between||input and response languages ( here natural language ))
(embedding||between||storage language ( here , the facts from KBs ))
(learning systems||centered around||memory component)
(memory component||can be||read and written to)
(Model||present||embedding - based QA system)
(embedding - based QA system||developed under||framework of Memory Networks ( Mem NNs ))
