(controller network||has||appropriately)
(programs / weights||adapting to||different functionalities)
(different functionalities||aligning with||different parts)
(different parts||of||sequential task)
(different functionalities||aligning with||different tasks)
(different tasks||in||continual and few - shot learning)
(Model||has||program memory)
(program memory||co-exists with||data memory)
(data memory||in||MANN)
