Abstract

Many modern NLP systems rely on word
embeddings, previously trained in an unsupervised manner on large corpora, as
base features. Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as
sentences, have however not been so successful. Several attempts at learning unsupervised representations of sentences have
not reached satisfactory enough performance to be widely adopted. In this paper,
we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of
the Stanford Natural Language Inference
datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors (Kiros et al., 2015) on a wide range
of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to
other tasks, our work tends to indicate the
suitability of natural language inference
for transfer learning to other NLP tasks.
Our encoder is publicly available! .

1 Introduction

Distributed representations of words (or word
embeddings) (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert et al.,
2011; Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,
2014) have shown to provide useful features for
various tasks in natural language processing and
computer vision. While there seems to be a consensus concerning the usefulness of word embeddings and how to learn them, this is not yet clear
with regard to representations that carry the meaning of a full sentence. That is, how to capture the
relationships among multiple words and phrases in
a single vector remains an question to be solved.

In this paper, we study the task of learning
universal representations of sentences, i.e., a sentence encoder model that is trained on a large corpus and subsequently transferred to other tasks.
Two questions need to be solved in order to build
such an encoder, namely: what is the preferable neural network architecture; and how and
on what task should such a network be trained.
Following existing work on learning word embeddings, most current approaches consider learning sentence encoders in an unsupervised manner
like SkipThought (Kiros et al., 2015) or FastSent
(Hill et al., 2016). Here, we investigate whether
supervised learning can be leveraged instead, taking inspiration from previous results in computer
vision, where many models are pretrained on the
ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) before being transferred. We compare sentence embeddings trained
on various supervised tasks, and show that sentence embeddings generated from models trained
on a natural language inference (NLI) task reach
the best results in terms of transfer accuracy. We
hypothesize that the suitability of NLI as a training task is caused by the fact that it is a high-level
understanding task that involves reasoning about
the semantic relationships within sentences.

Unlike in computer vision, where convolutional
neural networks are predominant, there are multiple ways to encode a sentence using neural networks. Hence, we investigate the impact of the
sentence encoding architecture on representational
transferability, and compare convolutional, recurrent and even simpler word composition schemes.
Our experiments show that an encoder based on a
bi-directional LSTM architecture with max pooling, trained on the Stanford Natural Language
Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015),
yields state-of-the-art sentence embeddings compared to all existing alternative unsupervised ap
‘https://www.github.com/ facebookresearch/ Iproachesdike SkipThought or FastSent, while being much faster to train. We establish this finding
on a broad and diverse set of transfer tasks that
measures the ability of sentence representations to
capture general and useful information.

2 Related work

Transfer learning using supervised features has
been successful in several computer vision applications (Razavian et al., 2014). Striking examples include face recognition (Taigman et al.,
2014) and visual question answering (Antol et al.,
2015), where image features trained on ImageNet
(Deng et al., 2009) and word embeddings trained
on large unsupervised corpora are combined.

In contrast, most approaches for sentence representation learning are unsupervised, arguably because the NLP community has not yet found the
best supervised task for embedding the semantics
of a whole sentence. Another reason is that neural networks are very good at capturing the biases of the task on which they are trained, but
can easily forget the overall information or semantics of the input data by specializing too much
on these biases. Learning models on large unsupervised task makes it harder for the model to
specialize. Littwin and Wolf (2016) showed that
co-adaptation of encoders and classifiers, when
trained end-to-end, can negatively impact the generalization power of image features generated by
an encoder. They propose a loss that incorporates
multiple orthogonal classifiers to counteract this
effect.

Recent work on generating sentence embeddings range from models that compose word
embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Arora et al.,
2017; Wieting et al., 2016) to more complex neural network architectures. SkipThought vectors
(Kiros et al., 2015) propose an objective function that adapts the skip-gram model for words
(Mikolov et al., 2013) to the sentence level. By encoding a sentence to predict the sentences around
it, and using the features in a linear model, they
were able to demonstrate good performance on 8
transfer tasks. They further obtained better results
using layer-norm regularization of their model in
(Ba et al., 2016). Hill et al. (2016) showed that
the task on which sentence embeddings are trained
significantly impacts their quality.

In addition to unsupervised methods, they included supervised training in their comparison—
namely, on machine translation data (using the

WMT’ 14 English/French and English/German
pairs), dictionary definitions and image captioning
data (see also Kiela et al. (2017)) from the COCO
dataset (Lin et al., 2014). These models obtained
significantly lower results compared to the unsupervised Skip-Thought approach.

Recent work has explored training sentence encoders on the SNLI corpus and applying them on
the SICK corpus (Marelli et al., 2014), either using multi-task learning or pretraining (Mou et al.,
2016; Bowman et al., 2015). The results were inconclusive and did not reach the same level as simpler approaches that directly learn a classifier on
top of unsupervised sentence embeddings instead
(Arora et al., 2017). To our knowledge, this work
is the first attempt to fully exploit the SNLI corpus for building generic sentence encoders. As we
show in our experiments, we are able to consistently outperform unsupervised approaches, even
if our models are trained on much less (but humanannotated) data.

3 Approach

This work combines two research directions,
which we describe in what follows. First, we explain how the NLI task can be used to train universal sentence encoding models using the SNLI task.
We subsequently describe the architectures that we
investigated for the sentence encoder, which, in
our opinion, covers a suitable range of sentence
encoders currently in use. Specifically, we examine standard recurrent models such as LSTMs and
GRUs, for which we investigate mean and maxpooling over the hidden representations; a selfattentive network that incorporates different views
of the sentence; and a hierarchical convolutional
network that can be seen as a tree-based method
that blends different levels of abstraction.

3.1 The Natural Language Inference task

The SNLI dataset consists of 570k humangenerated English sentence pairs, manually labeled with one of three categories: entailment,
contradiction and neutral. It captures natural language inference, also known in previous incarnations as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE),
and constitutes one of the largest high-quality labeled resources explicitly constructed in order to
require understanding sentence semantics. We hypothesize that the semantic nature of NLI makes
it a good candidate for learning universal sentence
embeddings in a supervised way. That is, we aim
to demonstrate that sentence encoders trained on
natural language inference are able to learn sentence representations that capture universally useful features.

Figure 1: Generic NLI training scheme.

Models can be trained on SNLI in two different ways: (i) sentence encoding-based models that
explicitly separate the encoding of the individual
sentences and (i1) joint methods that allow to use
encoding of both sentences (to use cross-features
or attention from one sentence to the other).

Since our goal is to train a generic sentence encoder, we adopt the first setting. As illustrated in
Figure |, a typical architecture of this kind uses a
shared sentence encoder that outputs a representation for the premise u and the hypothesis v. Once
the sentence vectors are generated, 3 matching
methods are applied to extract relations between
u and v : (i) concatenation of the two representations (u,v); (ii) element-wise product wu * v; and
(iii) absolute element-wise difference |u — v|. The
resulting vector, which captures information from
both the premise and the hypothesis, is fed into
a 3-class classifier consisting of multiple fullyconnected layers culminating in a softmax layer.

3.2 Sentence encoder architectures

A wide variety of neural networks for encoding sentences into fixed-size representations exists, and it is not yet clear which one best captures generically useful information. We compare 7 different architectures: standard recurrent
encoders with either Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), concatenation of last hidden states of forward and
backward GRU, Bi-directional LSTMs (BiLSTM)
with either mean or max pooling, self-attentive

network and hierarchical convolutional networks.

3.2.1 LSTM and GRU

Our first, and simplest, encoders apply recurrent neural networks using either LSTM
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) or GRU
(Cho et al., 2014) modules, as in sequence to sequence encoders (Sutskever et al., 2014). For
a sequence of T words (wj,...,w7), the network computes a set of 7’ hidden representations
a

hy,..., hr, with hy = LSTM(w1, vee , wr) (or
using GRU units instead). A sentence is represented by the last hidden vector, hr.

We also consider a model BiGRU-last that concatenates the last hidden state of a forward GRU,
and the last hidden state of a backward GRU to
have the same architecture as for SkipThought
vectors.

3.2.2. BiLSTM with mean/max pooling

For a sequence of T words {w+ }:=1,....7, a bidirectional LSTM computes a set of T vectors {h;};.
For t € [1,...,Z], hy, is the concatenation of a
forward LSTM and a backward LSTM that read
the sentences in two opposite directions:

hy = LSTM;(w1, a 2 , wr)

he — STM, (wi, ’ wr)
—

hy — [he, hil

We experiment with two ways of combining the
varying number of {h;}; to form a fixed-size vector, either by selecting the maximum value over
each dimension of the hidden units (max pooling) (Collobert and Weston, 2008) or by considering the average of the representations (mean pool
ing).

3.2.3 Self-attentive network

The self-attentive sentence encoder (Liu et al.,
2016; Lin et al., 2017) uses an attention mechanism over the hidden states of a BiLSTM to generate a representation u of an input sentence. The
attention mechanism is defined as :

h; = tanh(Wh, + by)
chi Uw
Qj =
a Sr cht uw Uw
t
where {h,,..., hr} are the output hidden vec
tors of a BiLSTM. These are fed to an affine transformation (W, 6.) which outputs a set of keys
(h1,...,hr). The {a;} represent the score of
similarity between the keys and a learned context query vector u,. These weights are used
to produce the final representation wu, which is a
weighted linear combination of the hidden vectors.

Following Linetal. (2017) we use a selfattentive network with multiple views of the input
sentence, so that the model can learn which part of
the sentence is important for the given task. Concretely, we have 4 context vectors ul, u?,, u3,, ui,
which generate 4 representations that are then concatenated to obtain the sentence representation w.
Figure 3 illustrates this architecture.

3.2.4 Hierarchical ConvNet

One of the currently best performing models on
classification tasks is a convolutional architecture
termed AdaSent (Zhao et al., 2015), which concatenates different representations of the sentences
at different level of abstractions. Inspired by this
architecture, we introduce a faster version consisting of 4 convolutional layers. At every layer, a

representation wu; 1s computed by a max-pooling
operation over the feature maps (see Figure 4).

The final representation u = [u1, U2, Us, U4|
concatenates representations at different levels of
the input sentence. The model thus captures hierarchical abstractions of an input sentence in a
fixed-size representation.

3.3 Training details

For all our models trained on SNLI, we use SGD
with a learning rate of 0.1 and a weight decay of
0.99. At each epoch, we divide the learning rate
by 5 if the dev accuracy decreases. We use minibatches of size 64 and training is stopped when the
learning rate goes under the threshold of 10~°. For
the classifier, we use a multi-layer perceptron with
1 hidden-layer of 512 hidden units. We use opensource GloVe vectors trained on Common Crawl
840B with 300 dimensions as fixed word embeddings.

4 Evaluation of sentence representations

Our aim is to obtain general-purpose sentence
embeddings that capture generic information that
is useful for a broad set of tasks. To evaluate the quality of these representations, we use
them as features in 12 transfer tasks. We present
our sentence-embedding evaluation procedure in

this section. We constructed a sentence evaluation tool? called SentEval (Conneau and Kiela,
2018) to automate evaluation on all the tasks
mentioned in this paper. The tool uses Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) to fit a logistic regression
classifier, with batch size 64.

Binary and multi-class classification We use
a set of binary classification tasks (see Table 1)
that covers various types of sentence classification, including sentiment analysis (MR, SST),
question-type (TREC), product reviews (CR), subjectivity/objectivity (SUBJ) and opinion polarity
(MPQA). We generate sentence vectors and train
a logistic regression on top. A linear classifier requires fewer parameters than an MLP and is thus
suitable for small datasets, where transfer learning
is especially well-suited. We tune the L2 penalty
of the logistic regression with grid-search on the
validation set.

Entailment and semantic relatedness We also
evaluate on the SICK dataset for both entailment
(SICK-E) and semantic relatedness (SICK-R). We
use the same matching methods as in SNLI and
learn a Logistic Regression on top of the joint representation. For semantic relatedness evaluation,
we follow the approach of (Tai et al., 2015) and
learn to predict the probability distribution of relatedness scores. We report Pearson correlation.

STS14 - Semantic Textual Similarity While
semantic relatedness is supervised in the case
of SICK-R, we also evaluate our embeddings
on the 6 unsupervised SemEval tasks of STS14
(Agirre et al., 2014). This dataset includes subsets of news articles, forum discussions, image descriptions and headlines from news articles containing pairs of sentences (lower-cased), labeled
with a similarity score between O and 5. These
tasks evaluate how the cosine distance between
two sentences correlate with a human-labeled similarity score through Pearson and Spearman corre
lations.

Paraphrase detection The Microsoft Research
Paraphrase Corpus is composed of pairs of sentences which have been extracted from news
sources on the Web. Sentence pairs have been
human-annotated according to whether they capture a paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship. We use the same approach as with SICK-E,
except that our classifier has only 2 classes.

Caption-Image retrieval The caption-image
retrieval task evaluates joint image and language
feature models (Hodosh et al., 2013; Lin et al.,
2014). The goal is either to rank a large collection of images by their relevance with respect to a
given query caption (Image Retrieval), or ranking
captions by their relevance for a given query image
(Caption Retrieval). We use a pairwise rankingloss Leir(X, y):

Ss Ss” max(0,a — s(Vy,Ux) + s(Vy, Uxz)) +
y ik

Ss S_ max(0, a — s(Ux,Vy) + s(Ux, Vyz'))
x k!

where (x,y) consists of an image y with one
of its associated captions x, (yz)x~ and (yp), are
negative examples of the ranking loss, a is the
margin and s corresponds to the cosine similarity.
U and V are learned linear transformations that
project the caption x and the image y to the same
embedding space. We use a margin a = 0.2 and
30 contrastive terms. We use the same splits as
in (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015), 1.e., we use 113k
images from the COCO dataset (each containing
5 captions) for training, 5k images for validation
and 5k images for test. For evaluation, we split the
5k images in 5 random sets of 1k images on which
we compute Recall@K, with K € {1,5,10} and
median (Med r) over the 5 splits. For fair comparison, we also report SkipThought results in our setting, using 2048-dimensional pretrained ResNet
*https://www.github.com/facebookresearch/ Skok fMeiet al., 2016) with 113k training images.

5 Empirical results

In this section, we refer to micro” and macro”
averages of development set (dev) results on transfer tasks whose metrics is accuracy: we compute a
macro” aggregated score that corresponds to the
classical average of dev accuracies, and the ’micro” score that is a sum of the dev accuracies,
weighted by the number of dev samples.

5.1 Architecture impact

Model We observe in Table 3 that different models trained on the same NLI corpus lead to different transfer tasks results. The BiLSTM-4096 with
the max-pooling operation performs best on both
SNLI and transfer tasks. Looking at the micro and

macro averages, we see that it performs significantly better than the other models LSTM, GRU,
BiGRU-last, BiLSTM-Mean, inner-attention and
the hierarchical-ConvNet.

Table 3 also shows that better performance on
the training task does not necessarily translate in
better results on the transfer tasks like when comparing inner-attention and BiLSTM-Mean for instance.

We hypothesize that some models are likely to
over-specialize and adapt too well to the biases of
a dataset without capturing general-purpose information of the input sentence. For example, the
inner-attention model has the ability to focus only
on certain parts of a sentence that are useful for
the SNLI task, but not necessarily for the transfer
tasks. On the other hand, BiLSTM-Mean does not
make sharp choices on which part of the sentence
is more important than others. The difference between the results seems to come from the different
abilities of the models to incorporate general information while not focusing too much on specific
features useful for the task at hand.

For a given model, the transfer quality is also
sensitive to the optimization algorithm: when
training with Adam instead of SGD, we observed
that the BiLSTM-max converged faster on SNLI
(5 epochs instead of 10), but obtained worse results on the transfer tasks, most likely because of
the model and classifier’s increased capability to
over-specialize on the training task.

Embedding size Figure 5 compares the overall performance of different architectures, showing
the evolution of micro averaged performance with
regard to the embedding size.

Since it is easier to linearly separate in high dimension, especially with logistic regression, it is
not surprising that increased embedding sizes lead
to increased performance for almost all models.

demonstrate unequal abilities to incorporate more
information as the size grows. We hypothesize
that such networks are able to incorporate information that is not directly relevant to the objective
task (results on SNLI are relatively stable with regard to embedding size) but that can nevertheless
be useful as features for transfer tasks.

We report in Table 4 transfer tasks results for
different architectures trained in different ways.
We group models by the nature of the data
on which they were trained. The first group

corresponds to models trained with unsupervised unordered sentences. This includes bagof-words models such as word2vec-SkipGram,
the Unigram-TFIDF model, the Paragraph Vector
model (Le and Mikolov, 2014), the Sequential Denoising Auto-Encoder (SDAE) (Hill et al., 2016)
and the SIF model (Arora et al., 2017), all trained
on the Toronto book corpus (Zhu et al., 2015). The
second group consists of models trained with unsupervised ordered sentences such as FastSent and
SkipThought (also trained on the Toronto book
corpus). We also include the FastSent variant
“FastSent+AE” and the SkipThought-LN version
that uses layer normalization. We report results

from models trained on supervised data in the third
group, and also report some results of supervised
methods trained directly on each task for comparison with transfer learning approaches.

Comparison with SkipThought The best
performing sentence encoder to date is the
SkipThought-LN model, which was trained on
a very large corpora of ordered sentences. With
much less data (570k compared to 64M sentences)
but with high-quality supervision from the SNLI
dataset, we are able to consistently outperform
the results obtained by SkipThought vectors. We
train our model in less than a day on a single GPU
compared to the best SkipThought-LN network
trained for a month. Our BiLSTM-max trained
on SNLI performs much better than released
SkipThought vectors on MR, CR, MPQA, SST,
MRPC-accuracy, SICK-R, SICK-E and STS14
(see Table 4). Except for the SUBJ dataset, it
also performs better than SkipThought-LN on
MR, CR and MPQA. We also observe by looking
at the STS14 results that the cosine metrics in
our embedding space is much more semantically
informative than in SkipThought embedding
Space (pearson score of 0.68 compared to 0.29
and 0.44 for ST and ST-LN). We hypothesize
that this is namely linked to the matching method
of SNLI models which incorporates a notion
of distance (element-wise product and absolute
difference) during training.

NLI as a supervised training set Our findings
indicate that our model trained on SNLI obtains
much better overall results than models trained
on other supervised tasks such as COCO, dictionary definitions, NMT, PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al.,
2013) and SST. For SST, we tried exactly the same

models as for SNLI; it is worth noting that SST is
smaller than NLI. Our representations constitute
higher-quality features for both classification and
similarity tasks. One explanation is that the natural language inference task constrains the model to
encode the semantic information of the input sentence, and that the information required to perform
NLI is generally discriminative and informative.

Domain adaptation on SICK tasks Our transfer learning approach obtains better results than
previous state-of-the-art on the SICK task - can
be seen as an out-domain version of SNLI - for
both entailment and relatedness. We obtain a pearson score of 0.885 on SICK-R while (Tai et al.,
2015) obtained 0.868, and we obtain 86.3% test
accuracy on SICK-E while previous best handengineered models (Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014)
obtained 84.5%. We also significantly outperformed previous transfer learning approaches on
SICK-E (Bowman et al., 2015) that used the parameters of an LSTM model trained on SNLI to
fine-tune on SICK (80.8% accuracy). We hypothesize that our embeddings already contain the information learned from the in-domain task, and that
learning only the classifier limits the number of
parameters learned on the small out-domain task.

Image-caption retrieval results In Table 5, we
report results for the COCO image-caption retrieval task. We report the mean recalls of 5 random splits of 1K test images. When trained with
ResNet features and 30k more training data, the
SkipThought vectors perform significantly better
than the original setting, going from 33.8 to 37.9
for caption retrieval R@1, and from 25.9 to 30.6
on image retrieval R@1. Our approach pushes
the results even further, from 37.9 to 42.4 on caption retrieval, and 30.6 to 33.2 on image retrieval.
These results are comparable to previous approach
of (Ma et al., 2015) that did not do transfer but directly learned the sentence encoding on the imagecaption retrieval task. This supports the claim that
pre-trained representations such as ResNet image
features and our sentence embeddings can achieve
competitive results compared to features learned
directly on the objective task.

MultiGenre NLI The MultiNLI corpus
(Williams et al., 2017) was recently released
as a multi-genre version of SNLI. With 433K
sentence pairs, MultiNLI improves upon SNLI
in its coverage: it contains ten distinct genres
of written and spoken English, covering most
of the complexity of the language. We augment
Table 4 with our model trained on both SNLI
and MultiNLI (AIINLI). We observe a significant
boost in performance overall compared to the
model trained only on SLNI. Our model even
reaches AdaSent performance on CR, suggesting
that having a larger coverage for the training task
helps learn even better general representations.
On semantic textual similarity STS14, we are
also competitive with PPDB based paragramphrase embeddings with a pearson score of 0.70.
Interestingly, on caption-related transfer tasks
such as the COCO image caption retrieval task,
training our sentence encoder on other genres
from MultiNLI does not degrade the performance
compared to the model trained only SNLI (which
contains mostly captions), which confirms the
generalization power of our embeddings.

6 Conclusion

This paper studies the effects of training sentence
embeddings with supervised data by testing on
12 different transfer tasks. We showed that models learned on NLI can perform better than models trained in unsupervised conditions or on other
supervised tasks. By exploring various architectures, we showed that a BiLSTM network with
max pooling makes the best current universal sentence encoding methods, outperforming existing
approaches like SkipThought vectors.

We believe that this work only scratches the surface of possible combinations of models and tasks
for learning generic sentence embeddings. Larger
datasets that rely on natural language understanding for sentences could bring sentence embedding
quality to the next level.

Appendix

Max-pooling visualization for BiLSTM-max
trained and untrained Our _ representations
were trained to focus on parts of a sentence such
that a classifier can easily tell the difference between contradictory, neutral or entailed sentences.

In Table 8 and Table 9, we investigate how
the max-pooling operation selects the information
from the hidden states of the BiLSTM, for our
trained and untrained BiLSTM-max models (for
both models, word embeddings are initialized with
GloVe vectors).

For each time step t, we report the number of
times the max-pooling operation selected the hidden state h; (which can be seen as a sentence representation centered around word w;).

Without any training, the max-pooling is rather
even across hidden states, although it seems to focus consistently more on the first and last hidden
States. When trained, the model learns to focus on
specific words that carry most of the meaning of
the sentence without any explicit attention mechanism.

Note that each hidden state also incorporates information from the sentence at different levels, explaining why the trained model also incorporates
information from all hidden states.
