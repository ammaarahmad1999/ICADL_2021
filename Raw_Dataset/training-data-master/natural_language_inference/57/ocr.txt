ABSTRACT

Hypernymy, textual entailment, and image captioning can be seen as special cases
of a single visual-semantic hierarchy over words, sentences, and images. In this
paper we advocate for explicitly modeling the partial order structure of this hierarchy. Towards this goal, we introduce a general method for learning ordered representations, and show how it can be applied to a variety of tasks involving images
and language. We show that the resulting representations improve performance
over current approaches for hypernym prediction and image-caption retrieval.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computer vision and natural language processing are becoming increasingly intertwined. Recent
work in vision has moved beyond discriminating between a fixed set of object classes, to automatically generating open-ended lingual descriptions of images (Vinyals et al.|[2015). Recent methods
for natural language processing such as (2014) learn the semantics of language by
grounding it in the visual world. Looking to the future, autonomous artificial agents will need to
jointly model vision and language in order to parse the visual world and communicate with people.

But what, precisely, is the relationship between images and the words or captions we use to describe
them? It is akin to the hypernym relation between words, and textual entailment among phrases:
captions are simply abstractions of images. In fact, all three relations can be seen as special cases
of a partial order over images and language, illustrated in Figure[I| which we refer to as the visual
semantic hierarchy. As a partial order, this relation 1s transitive: “woman walking her dog”, “woman

walking”, “person walking’, “person”, and “entity” are all valid abstractions of the rightmost image.
Our goal in this work is to learn representations that respect this partial order structure.

Most recent approaches to modeling the hypernym, entailment, and image-caption relations involve
learning distributed representations or embeddings. This is a very powerful and general approach
which maps the objects of interest—words, phrases, images— to points in a high-dimensional vector

space. One line of work, exemplified by|Chopra et al.}(2005) and first applied to the caption-image
relationship by (2014), requires the mapping to be distance-preserving: semantically
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016

 

similar objects are mapped to points that are nearby in the embedding space. A symmetric distance
measure such as Euclidean or cosine distance is typically used. Since the visual-semantic hierarchy
is an antisymmetric relation, we expect this approach to introduce systematic model error.

Other approaches do not have such explicit constraints, learning a more-or-less general binary relation between the objects of interest, e.g. [Bordes et al.|(2011);|Socher et al.](2013);/Ma et al.|(2015).
Notably, no existing approach directly imposes the transitivity and antisymmetry of the partial order,
leaving the model to induce these properties from data.

In contrast, we propose to exploit the partial order structure of the visual-semantic hierarchy by
learning a mapping which is not distance-preserving but order-preserving between the visualsemantic hierarchy and a partial order over the embedding space. We call embeddings learned
in this way order-embeddings. This idea can be integrated into existing relational learning methods simply by replacing their comparison operation with ours. By modifying existing methods in
this way, we find that order-embeddings provide a marked improvement over the state-of-art for
hypernymy prediction and caption-image retrieval, and near state-of-the-art performance for natural
language inference.

This paper is structured as follows. We begin, in Section |2| by giving a unified mathematical treatment of our tasks, and describing the general approach of learning order-embeddings. In the next
three sections we describe in detail the tasks we tackle, how we apply the order-embeddings idea
to each of them, and the results we obtain. The tasks are hypernym prediction (Section|3), captionimage retrieval (Section|4), and textual entailment (Section|5).

In the supplementary material, we visualize novel vector regularities that emerge in our learned
embeddings of images and language.

2 LEARNING ORDER-EMBEDDINGS

To unify our treatment of various tasks, we introduce the problem of partial order completion. In
partial order completion, we are given a set of positive examples P = {(u,v)} of ordered pairs
drawn from a partially ordered set (X, <x), and a set of negative examples NV which we know to
be unordered. Our goal is to predict whether an unseen pair (u’, v’) is ordered. Note that hypernym
prediction, caption-image retrieval, and textual entailment are all special cases of this task, since
they all involve classifying pairs of concepts in the (partially ordered) visual-semantic hierarchy.

We tackle this problem by learning a mapping from X into a partially ordered embedding space
(Y, xy). The idea is to predict the ordering of an unseen pair in X based on its ordering in the
embedding space. This is possible only if the mapping satisfies the following crucial property:

Definition 1. A function f : (X,<x) — (Y, xy) is an order-embedding if for all u,v € X,
u Xx vifand only if f(u) xy f(v)

This definition implies that each combination of embedding space Y, order <y, and orderembedding f determines a unique completion of our data as a partial order <x. In the following,
we first consider the choice of Y and <y, and then discuss how to find an appropriate f.

2.1 THE REVERSED PRODUCT ORDER ON RY

The choice of Y and <y is somewhat application-dependent. For the purpose of modeling the
semantic hierarchy, our choices are narrowed by the following considerations.

Much of the expressive power of human language comes from abstraction and composition. For any
two concepts, say “dog” and “cat”, we can name a concept that is an abstraction of the two, such
as “mammal”, as well as a concept that composes the two, such as “dog chasing cat’. So, in order
to represent the visual-semantic hierarchy, we need to choose an order <y that is rich enough to
embed these two relations.

We also restrict ourselves to orders ~y with a top element, which is above every other element in the
order. In the visual-semantic hierarchy, this element represents the most general possible concept;
practically, it provides an anchor for the embedding.
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016

 

Finally, we choose the embedding space Y to be continuous in order to allow optimization with
gradient-based methods.

A natural choice that satisfies all three properties is the reversed product order on RY, defined by
the conjunction of total orders on each coordinate:
N
x X yifandonly if /\ x; > yi (1)
i=1
for all vectors x, y with nonnegative coordinates. Note the reversal of direction: smaller coordinates
imply higher position in the partial order. The origin is then the top element of the order, representing
the most general concept.

Instead of viewing our embeddings as single points 7 € RY , we can also view them as sets {y :
x < y}. The meaning of a word is then the union of all concepts of which it is a hypernym, and the
meaning of a sentence is the union of all sentences that entail it. The visual-semantic hierarchy can

then be seen as a special case of the subset relation, a connection also used by} Young et al.|(2014).

2.2. PENALIZING ORDER VIOLATIONS

Having fixed the embedding space and order, we now consider the problem of finding an orderembedding into this space. In practice, the order embedding condition (Definition|1) is too restrictive
to impose as a hard constraint. Instead, we aim to find an approximate order-embedding: a mapping
which violates the order-embedding condition, imposed as a soft constraint, as little as possible.

More precisely, we define a penalty that measures the degree to which a pair of points violates the
product order. In particular, we define the penalty for an ordered pair (x, y) of points in Ri as

E(a,y) = ||max(0,y — «)||° (2)

Crucially, E(z,y) =0 <=> « ~X y according to the reversed product order; if the order is not
satisfied, E(x, y) is positive. This effectively imposes a strong prior on the space of relations, encouraging our learned relation to satisfy the partial order properties of transitivity and antisymmetry.
This penalty is key to our method. Throughout the remainder of the paper, we will use it where
previous work has used symmetric distances or learned comparison operators.

Recall that P and N are our positive and negative examples, respectively. Then, to learn an approximate order-embedding f, we could use a max-margin loss which encourages positive examples to
have zero penalty, and negative examples to have penalty greater than a margin:

>» Ef), f(e))+ > max{0,a— E(f(u'), fv'))} (3)

(u,v)EP (u’,v’/)EN

In practice we are often not given negative examples, in which case this loss admits the trivial
solution of mapping all objects to the same point. The best way of dealing with this problem depends
on the application, so we will describe task-specific variations of the loss in the next several sections.

3. HYPERNYM PREDICTION

To test the ability of our model to learn partial orders from incomplete data, our first task is to predict
withheld hypernym pairs in WordNet (Miller|/1995). A hypernym pair is a pair of concepts where
the first concept is a specialization or an instance of the second, e.g., (woman, person) or (New York,
city). Our setup differs significantly from previous work in that we use only the WordNet hierarchy
as training data. The most similar evaluation has been that of (2012), who use external
linguistic data in the form of distributional semantic vectors. (2011) and|Socher et al.|
also evaluate on the WordNet hierarchy, but they use other relations in WordNet as training
data (and external linguistic data, in Socher’s case).

Additionally, the latter two consider only direct hypernyms, rather than the full, transitive hypernymy relation. But predicting the transitive hypernym relation is a better-defined problem because
individual hypernym edges in WordNet vary dramatically in the degree of abstraction they require.
For instance, (person, organism) is a direct hypernym pair, but it takes eight hypernym edges to get
from cat to organism.

3.1 LOSS FUNCTION

To apply order-embeddings to hypernymy, we follow the setup of (2013) in learning
an N-dimensional vector for each concept in WordNet, but we replace their neural tensor network

with our order-violation penalty defined in Eq. (2). Just like them, we corrupt each hypernym pair
by replacing one of the two concepts with a randomly chosen concept, and use these corrupted
pairs as negative examples for both training and evaluation. We use their max-margin loss, which
encourages the order-violation penalty to be zero for positive examples, and greater than a margin a
for negative examples:

S> E(f(u), f(v)) + max{0, a — E(f(u’), f(v'))} (4)
(u,v)€WordNet

where F is our order-violation penalty, and (u’, v’) is a corrupted version of (u,v). Since we learn
an independent embedding for each concept, the mapping f is simply a lookup table.

3.2 DATASET

The transitive closure of the WordNet hierarchy gives us 838073 edges between 82192 concepts in

WordNet. Like (2011), we randomly select 4000 edges for the test split, and another
A000 for the development set. Note that the majority of test set edges can be inferred simply by

applying transitivity, giving us a strong baseline.

3.3. DETAILS OF TRAINING

We learn a 50-dimensional nonnegative vector for each concept in WordNet using the max-margin
objective (4) with margin a = 1, sampling 500 true and 500 false hypernym pairs in each batch. We

train for 30-50 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba}}2015) with learning rate 0.01 and

early stopping on the validation set. During evaluation, we find the optimal classification threshold
on the validation set, then apply it to the test set.

3.4 RESULTS

 

Since our setup is novel, there are no published numbers
to compare to. We therefore compare three variants of our
model to two baselines, with results shown in Table[]]

4 CAPTION-IMAGE RETRIEVAL

The caption-image retrieval task has become a standard evaluation of joint models of vision and
language (2014a). The task involves ranking a large dataset of
images by relevance for a query caption (Image Retrieval), and ranking captions by relevance for
a query image (Caption Retrieval). Given a set of aligned image-caption pairs as training data, the
goal is then to learn a caption-image compatibility score S(c, 7) to be used at test time.

Many modern approaches model the caption-image relationship symmetrically, either by embedding

into a common “visual-semantic” space with inner-product similarity (Socher et al.| {2014
2014), or by using Canonical Correlations Analysis between distributed representations of

images and captions (Klein et al.}|2015). While|Karpathy & Li}(2015) and (2015)

model a finer-grained alignment between regions in the image and segments of the caption, the
similarity they use is still symmetric. An alternative is to learn an unconstrained binary relation,

either with a neural language model conditioned on the image (Vinyals et al.| 2015}
2015) or using a multimodal CNN 2015).

In contrast to these lines of work, we propose to treat the caption-image pairs as a two-level partial
order with captions above the images they describe, and let

S(c, i) — — Ee alts fe(e))

with & our order-violation penalty defined in Eq (2). and f., f; are embedding functions from captions and images into Ri.

4.1 LOSS FUNCTION

To facilitate comparison, we use the same pairwise ranking loss that (2014),/Kiros et al.|
(2014) and|Karpathy & Li}(2015) have used on this task—simply replacing their symmetric similar
ity measure with our asymmetric order-violation penalty. This loss function encourages S(c, i) for
ground truth caption-image pairs to be greater than that for all other pairs, by a margin:

S- (>: max{0,a — S(c,i) + S(c,i)} + 5S max{0, a — S(c,i) + S(c, )) (5)
(c,2) a!

where (c, 7) is a ground truth caption-image pair, c’ goes over captions that no describe 7, and 7’ goes
over image not described by c.

4.2 IMAGE AND CAPTION EMBEDDINGS

To learn f, and f;, we use the approach of (2014) except, since we are embedding into

RY , we constrain the embedding vectors to have nonnegative entries by taking their absolute value.
Thus, to embed images, we use
fi(i) = |W; -CNN(i)| (6)

where W; is a learned N x 4096 matrix, N being the dimensionality of the embedding space.
CN N (1) is the same image feature used by (2015): we rescale images to have smallest

side 256 pixels, we take 224 x 224 crops from the corners, center, and their horizontal reflections,

run the 10 crops through the 19-layer VGG network of |Simonyan & Zisserman| (2015) (weights

pre-trained on ImageNet and fixed during training), and average their fc7 features.

the 5000-image test set, as in 2015). Best results overall are in bold; best results using
l-crop VGG features are underlined.

To embed the captions, we use a recurrent neural net encoder with GRU activations
2014), so f.(c) = |GRU (c)|, the absolute value of hidden state after processing the last word.

4.3. DATASET

 

We evaluate on the Microsoft COCO dataset 2014b), which has over 120,000 images,
each with at least five human-annotated captions per image. This is by far the largest dataset com
monly used for caption-image retrieval. We use the data splits of|Karpathy & Li)(2015) for training
(113,287 images), validation (5000 images), and test (S000 images).

4.4 DETAILS OF TRAINING

To train the model, we use the standard pairwise ranking objective from Eq. (5). We sample minibatches of 128 random image-caption pairs, and draw all contrastive terms from the minibatch,
giving us 127 contrastive images for each caption and captions for each image. We train for 15-30
epochs using the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001, and early stopping on the validation set.

We set the dimension of the embedding space and the GRU hidden state NV to 1024, the dimension of
the learned word embeddings to 300, and the margin a to 0.05. All these hyperparameters, as well
as the learning rate and batchsize, were selected using the validation set. For consistency with|Kiros|
and to mitigate overfitting, we constrain the caption and image embeddings to have unit
L2 norm. This constraint implies that no two points can be exactly ordered with zero order-violation
penalty, but since we use a ranking loss, only the relative size of the penalties matters.

4.5. RESULTS

Given a query caption or image, we sort all the images or captions of the test set in order of increasing
penalty. We use standard ranking metrics for evaluation. We measure Recall@ Kk, the percent of
queries for which the GT term is one of the first AK retrieved; and median and mean rank, which are
statistics over the position of the GT term in the retrieval order.

Table [2| shows a comparison between all state-of-the-art and some older method4?| along with our
own; see|[Ma et al.](2015) for a more complete listing.

The best results overall are in bold, and the best results using 1-crop VGG image features are underlined. Note that the comparison is additionally complicated by the following:

e m-CNNewnsg is an ensemble of four different models, whereas the other entries are all
single models.

e STV and FV use external text corpora to learn their language features, whereas the other
methods learn them from scratch.

To facilitate the comparison and to evaluate the contributions of various components of our model,
we evaluate four variations of order-embeddings:

order-embeddings is our full model as described above.

order-embeddings (reversed) reverses the order of captions and image embeddings in our orderviolation penalty—placing images above captions in the partial order learned by our model. This
seemingly slight variation performs atrociously, confirming our prior that captions are much more
abstract than images, and should be placed higher in the semantic hierarchy.

order-embeddings (1-crop) computes the image feature using just the center crop, instead of averaging over 10 crops.

order-embeddings (symm.) replaces our asymmetric penalty with the symmetric cosine distance,
and allows embedding coordinates to be negative—essentially replicating MNLM, but with better
image features. Here we find that a different margin (a = 0.2) works best.

Between these four models, the only previous work whose results are incommensurable with ours is

DVSA, since it uses the less discriminative CNN of|Krizhevsky et al.}(2012) but 20 region features

instead of a single whole-image feature.

Aside from this limitation, and if only single models are considered, order-embeddings significantly
outperform the state-of-art approaches for image retrieval even when we control for image features.

4.6 EXPLORATION

Why would order-embeddings do well on such a shallow partial order? Why are they much more
helpful for image retrieval than for caption retrieval?

Intuitively, symmetric similarity should fail when an image has captions with very different levels
of detail, because the captions are so dissimilar that it is impossible to map both their embeddings
close to the same image embedding. Order-embeddings don’t have this problem: the less detailed
caption can be embedded very far away from the image while remaining above it in the partial order.

To evaluate this intuition, we use caption length as a proxy for level of detail and select, among pairs
of co-referring captions in our validation set, the 100 pairs with the biggest length difference. For
image retrieval with 1000 target images, the mean rank over captions in this set is 6.4 for orderembeddings and 9.7 for cosine similarity, a much bigger difference than over the entire dataset.
Some particularly dramatic examples of this are shown in Figure[3| Moreover, if we use the shorter
caption as a query, and retrieve captions in order of increasing error, the mean rank of the longer
caption is 34.0 for order-embeddings and 47.6 for cosine similarity, showing that order-embeddings
are able to capture the relatedness of co-referring captions with very different lengths.

This also explains why order-embeddings provide a much smaller improvement for caption retrieval
than for image retrieval: all the caption retrieval metrics are based on the position of the first ground
truth caption in the retrieval order, so the embeddings need only learn to retrieve one of each image’s
five captions well, which symmetric similarity is well suited for.

Note that the numbers for MNLM come not from the published paper but from the recently released code

5 TEXTUAL ENTAILMENT / NATURAL LANGUAGE INFERENCE

Natural language inference can be seen as a generalization of hypernymy from words to sentences.
For example, from “woman walking her dog in a park” we can infer both “woman walking her dog”
and “dog in a park’, but not ’old woman” or black dog’. Given a pair of sentences, our task is to
predict whether we can infer the second sentence (the hypothesis) from the first (the premise).

5.1 LOSS FUNCTION

To apply order-embeddings to this task, we again view it as partial order completion—we can infer
a hypothesis from a premise exactly when the hypothesis is above the premise in the visual-semantic
hierarchy.

Unlike our other tasks, for which we had to generate contrastive negatives, datasets for natural
language inference include labeled negative examples. So, we can simply use a max-margin loss:

S” E(f(p), f(A) + S— max{0,a — E(f(p'), f(h’))} (7)

(p,h) (gp git")

where (p, h) are positive and (p’, h’) negative pairs of premise and hypothesis. To embed sentences,
we use the same GRU encoder as in the caption-image retrieval task.

5.2 DATASET

To evaluate order-embeddings on the natural language inference task, we use the recently proposed
SNLI corpus (2015), which contains 570,000 pairs of sentences, each labeled with
“entailment” if the inference is valid, “contradiction” if the two sentences contradict, or “neutral”
if the inference is invalid but there is no contradiction. Our method only allows us to discriminate between entailment and non-entailment, so we merge the “contradiction” and “neutral” classes
together to serve as our negative examples.

5.3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Just as for caption-image ranking, we set the dimensions of the embedding space and GRU hidden
state to be 1024, the dimension of the word embeddings to be 300, and constrain the embeddings to
have unit L2 norm. We train for 10 epochs with batches of 128 sentence pairs. We use the Adam
optimizer with learning rate 0.001 and early stopping on the validation set. During evaluation, we
find the optimal classification threshold on validation, then use the threshold to classify the test set.

5.4 RESULTS

The state-of-the-art method for 3-class classification on SNLI is that of |Rocktaschel et al.} (2015).

Unfortunately, they do not compute 2-class accuracy, so we cannot compare to them directly.

As a bridge to facilitate comparison, we use a challenging baseline which can be evaluated on both
the 2-class and 3-class problems. The baseline, referred to as skip-thoughts, involves a feedforward neural network on top of skip-thought vectors (Kiros et al.||2015), a state-of-the-art semantic
representation of sentences. Given pairs of sentence vectors u and v, the input to the network is
the concatenation of wu, v and the absolute difference |u — v|. We tuned the number of layers, layer
dimensionality and dropout rates to optimize performance on the development set, using the Adam
optimizer. Batch normalization and PReLU units were
used. Our best network used 2 hidden layers of 1000 units each, with dropout rate of 0.5 across both
the input and hidden layers. We did not backpropagate through the skip-thought encoder.

We also evaluate against EOP classifier, a 2-class baseline introduced by 2015),

and against a version of our model where our order-violation penalty is replaced with the symmetric
cosine distance, order-embeddings (Symmetric).

The results for all models are shown in Table|3] We see that order-embeddings outperform the skipthought baseline despite not using external text corpora. While our method is almost certainly worse

than the state-of-the-art method of|Rocktaschel et al.|(2015), which uses a word-by-word attention

mechanism, it is also much simpler.

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We introduced a simple method to encode order into learned distributed representations, which allows us to explicitly model the partial order structure of the visual-semantic hierarchy. Our method
can be easily integrated into existing relational learning methods, as we demonstrated on three challenging tasks involving computer vision and natural language processing. On two of these tasks,
hypernym prediction and caption-image retrieval, our methods outperform all previous work.

A promising direction of future work is to learn better classifiers on ImageNet (Deng et al.||/2009),
which has over 21k image classes arranged by the WordNet hierarchy. Previous approaches, includ
ing {Frome et al.| (2013) and {Norouzi et al.|(2014) have embedded words and images into a shared
semantic space with symmetric similarity—which our experiments suggest to be a poor fit with the
partial order structure of WordNet. We expect significant progress on ImageNet classification, and
the related problems of one-shot and zero-shot learning, to be possible using order-embeddings.

Going further, order-embeddings may enable learning the entire semantic hierarchy in a single model
which jointly reasons about hypernymy, entailment, and the relationship between perception and
language, unifying what have been until now almost independent lines of work.

7 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

Mikolov et al.| (2013) showed that word representations learned using word2vec exhibit semantic
regularities, such as king — man + woman ~ queen. (2014) showed that similar

regularities hold for joint image-language models. We find that order-embeddings exhibit a novel
form of regularity, shown in Figure|4] The elementwise max and min operations in the embedding
space roughly correspond to composition and abstraction, respectively.
