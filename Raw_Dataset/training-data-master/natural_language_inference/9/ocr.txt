ABSTRACT

In this paper, we study the problem of question answering when reasoning over
multiple facts is required. We propose Query-Reduction Network (QRN), a variant
of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that effectively handles both short-term (local)
and long-term (global) sequential dependencies to reason over multiple facts. QRN
considers the context sentences as a sequence of state-changing triggers, and
reduces the original query to a more informed query as it observes each trigger
(context sentence) through time. Our experiments show that QRN produces the
state-of-the-art results in bAbI QA and dialog tasks, and in a real goal-oriented
dialog dataset. In addition, QRN formulation allows parallelization on RNN’s time
axis, Saving an order of magnitude in time complexity for training and inference.

1 INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we address the problem of question answering (QA) when reasoning over multiple
facts is required. For example, consider we know that Frogs eat insectsandFlies are
insects. Then answering Do frogs eat flies? requires reasoning over both of the above
facts. Question answering, more specifically context-based QA, has been extensively studied in
machine comprehension tasks
(2016). However, most of the datasets are primarily focused on lexical and syntactic
understanding, and hardly concentrate on inference over multiple facts. Recently, several aaa
aimed for testing multi-hop reasoning have emerged; among them are story-based QA {Weston et al.
and the dialog task (Bordes and Weston) 2016)

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al. {2014),
are popular choices for modeling natural language. However, when used for multi-hop reasoning in
question answering, purely RNN-based models have shown to perform poorly (Weston et al.|/2016).
This is largely due to the fact that RNN’s internal memory is inherently unstable over a long term. For
this reason, most recent approaches in the literature have mainly relied on global attention mechanism
and shared external memory (Sukhbaatar et al.| 2015} Peng et al.) [2013] Xiong et al. 2016) [Graves
fet al.|{2016). The attention mechanism allows these models to focus on a single sentence in each layer.
They can sequentially read multiple relevant sentences from the memory with multiple layers to
perform multi-hop reasoning. However, one major drawback of these standard attention mechanisms
is that they are insensitive to the time step (memory address) of the sentences when accessing them.

Our proposed model, Query-Reduction Network! |QRN), is a single recurrent unit that addresses
the long-term dependency problem of most RNN-based models by simplifying the recurrent update,
while taking the advantage of RNN’s capability to model sequential data (Figure[I). QRN considers
the context sentences as a sequence of state-changing triggers, and transforms (reduces) the original
query to a more informed query as it observes each trigger through time. For instance in Figure[Ib] the
original question, Where is the apple?, cannot be directly answered by any single sentence
from the story. After observing the first sentence, Sandra got the apple there, QRN
transforms the original question to a reduced query Where is Sandra?, which is presumably

easier to answer than the original question given the context provided by the first sentence/’| Unlike
RNN-based models, QRN’s candidate state (h; in Figure La) does not depend on the previous hidden

state (h;_;). Compared to memory-based approaches (Weston et al.}|2015}|Sukhbaatar et al.}/2015}
2015}{Kumar et al.|/2016} 2016), QRN can better encodes locality information

because it does not use a global memory access controller (circle nodes in Figure|2h, and the query
updates are performed locally.

In short, the main contribution of QRN is threefold. First, QRN is a simple variant of RNN that
reduces the query given the context sentences in a differentiable manner. Second, QRN is situated
between the attention mechanism and RNN, effectively handling time dependency and long-term
dependency problems of each technique, respectively. Hence it is well-suited for sequential data with
both local and global interactions (note that QRN is not the replacement of RNN, which is arguably
better for modeling complex local interactions). Third, unlike most RNN-based models, QRN can be
parallelized over time by computing candidate reduced queries (h;) directly from local input queries
(q;z) and context sentence vectors (x;). In fact, the parallelizability of QRN implies that QRN does
not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem of RNN, hence effectively addressing the long-term
dependency. We experimentally demonstrate these contributions by achieving the state-of-the-art
results on story-based QA and interactive dialog datasets.

2 MODEL

In story-based QA (or dialog dataset), the input is the context as a sequence of sentences (story or
past conversations) and a question in natural language (equivalent to the user’s last utterance in the
dialog). The output is the predicted answer to the question in natural language (the system’s next
utterance in the dialog). The only supervision provided during training is the answer to the question.

In this paper we particularly focus on end-to-end solutions, 1.e., the only supervision comes from
questions and answers, and we restrain from using manually defined rules or external language
resources, such as lexicon or dependency parser. Let (a ,..., a7) denote the sequence of sentences,
where T’ is the number of sentences in the story, and let q denote the question. Let y denote the
predicted answer, and y denote the true answer. Our proposed system for end-to-end QA task is
divided into three modules (Figure[Ic): input module, QRN layers, and output module.

Input module. Input module maps each sentence x; and the question q to d-dimensional vector
space, x, € R@ and q; € R®. We adopt a previous solution for the input module (details in Section|5).

°This mechanism is akin to logic regression in situation calculus 2001).
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

 

QRN layers. QRN layers use the sentence vectors and the question vector from the input module to
obtain the predicted answer in vector space, y € R?. A QRN layer refers to the recurrent application
of a QRN unit, which can be considered as a variant of RNN with two inputs, two outputs, and a
hidden state (reduced query), all of which operate in vector space. The details of the QRN module is

explained throughout this section (2.1}[2.2).

Output module. Output module maps y obtained from QRN to a natural language answer y.
Similar to the input module, we adopt a standard solution for the output module (details in Section|5).

We first formally define the base model of a QRN unit, and then we explain how we connect the input
and output modules to it (Section}2.1). We also present a few extensions to the network that can
improve QRN’s performance (Section}2.2). Finally, we show that QRN can be parallelized over time,
giving computational advantage over most RNN-based models by one order of magnitude (Section[3).

2.1 QRN UNIT

As an RNN-based model, QRN is a single recurrent unit that updates its hidden state (reduced query)
through time and layers. Figure[1al depicts the schematic structure of a QRN unit, and Figure
demonstrates how layers are stacked. A QRN unit accepts two inputs (Jocal query vector q; € R*°
and sentence vector x; € R%), and two outputs (reduced query vector h, € R®%, which is similar
to the hidden state in RNN, and the sentence vector x; from the input without modification). The
local query vector is not necessarily identical to the original query (question) vector q. In order
to compute the outputs, we use update gate function a : R?4 x R¢@ > [0,1] and reduce function
p: R? x R? > R?. Intuitively, the update gate function measures the relevance between the sentence
and the local query and is used to update the hidden state. The reduce function transforms the local
query input to a candidate state which is a new reduced (easier) query given the sentence. The outputs
are calculated with the following equations:

Zp = a(Xt, Qt) = o(W (x, 0 qi) + b)) (1)
hy = p(X, qr) = tanh(W [x;; q,] + b®) (2)
hi = zhy + (1 — z%)hy_-1 (3)

where z; is the scalar update gate, h; is the candidate reduced query, and h; is the final reduced
query at time step t, o(-) is sigmoid activation, tanh(-) is hyperboolic tangent activation (applied
element-wise), W‘?) € R!*4, W®) € R?*?4 are weight matrices, b(*) € R, b‘®) € R@ are bias
terms, o is element-wise vector multiplication, and [;] is vector concatenation along the row. As
a base case, ho = O. Here we have explicitly defined a and p, but they can be any reasonable
differentiable functions.

The update gate is similar to the global attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al.}/2015)

2016) in that it measures the similarity between the sentence (a memory slot) and the query. However,
a significant difference is that the update gate is computed using sigmoid (c) function on the current
memory slot only (hence internally embedded within the unit), whereas the global attention is
computed using softmax function over the entire memory (hence globally defined). The update gate
can be rather considered as local sigmoid attention.

Stacking layers We just showed the single-layer case of QRN, but QRN with multiple layers is
able to perform reasoning over multiple facts more effectively, as shown in the example of Figure[1b|
In order to stack several layers of QRN, the outputs of the current layer are used as the inputs to
the next layer. That is, using superscript & to denote the current layer’s index (assuming 1-based
indexing), we let qitt — h?. Note that x, is passed to the next layer without any modification, so
we do not put a layer index on it.

Bi-direction. So far we have assumed that QRN only needs to look at past sentences, whereas
often times, query answers can depend on future sentences. For instance, consider a sentence “John
dropped the football.” at time ¢. Then, even if there is no mention about the “football” in the past
(at time z < ¢), it can be implied that “John” has the “football” at the current time ¢. In order to

incorporate the future dependency, we obtain h, and h,; in both forward and backward directions,
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

 

respectively, using Equation[3| We then add them together to get q; for the next layer. That is,
—
git! = nk + hf (4)

for layer indices 1 < k < K — 1. Note that the variables W“), b@, W“)  b(®) are shared between
the two directions.

Connecting input and output modules. Figure[Ic|depicts how QRN is connected with the input
and output modules. In the first layer of QRN, q} = q for all t, where q is obtained from the input
module by processing the natural language question input q. x; 1s also obtained from a; by the same
input module. The output at the last time step in the last layer is passed to the output module. That is,
y = h* where K represent the number of layers in the network. Then the output module gives the
predicted answer y in natural language.

2.2 EXTENSIONS

Here we introduce a few extensions of QRN, and later in our experiments, we test QRN’s performance
with and without each of these extensions.

Reset gate. Inspired by GRU (Cho et al.}|2014), we found that it is useful to allow the QRN unit

to reset (nullify) the candidate reduced query (i.e., hy) when necessary. For this we use a reset gate
function 8 : R? x R¢ — [0, 1], which can be defined similarly to the update gate function:

Cg B(x, qi) — o(w (xy O qt) + bo”) (5)
where W“") € R!*4 isa weight matrix, and b(") © Ris a bias term. Equation|3]is rewritten as
hi = zerchy + (1 — z)hy-1. (6)

Note that we do not use the reset gate in the last layer.

Vector gates. As in LSTM and GRU, update and reset gates can be vectors instead of scalar values
for fine-controlled gating. For vector gates, we modify the row dimension of weights and biases in
Equation{1]and|5|from 1 to d. Then we obtain z;,r; € R®@ (instead of z;,r; € IR), and these can be
element-wise multiplied (0) instead of being broadcasted in Equation|3|and|6]

3. PARALLELIZATION

An important advantage of QRN is that the recurrent updates in Equation[3]and[5|can be computed in
parallel across time. This is in contrast with most RNN-based models that cannot be parallelized,
where computing the candidate hidden state at time ¢ explicitly requires the previous hidden state.
In QRN, the final reduced queries (h;) can be decomposed into computing over candidate reduced
queries (h;), without looking at the previous reduced query. Here we primarily show that the
query update in Equation|3|can be parallelized by rewriting the equation with matrix operations.
The extension to Equation|5]is straightforward. The proof for QRN with vector gates is shown in
Appendix |B] The recursive definition of Equation3|can be explicitly written as

t t t t
h, = Ss II 1 — gs z;h; = S_ exp Ss log (1 — z;) 2, hj. (7)
i=1 | j=i4+1 i=1 j=i4+1
Let b; = log(1 — z;) for brevity. Then we can rewrite Equation|7|as the following equation:
h} 0 —0o —0o Lee OO ahi
hj — |exp bz + b3 bs 0 wee OO zgh4 (8)

Let H = [hy ; vial hj] be a T7'-by-d matrix where the transposes (T) of the column vectors h,

are concatenated across row. We similarly define H from hy. Also, let z = [z1;...; 27] and
b = [0; bg;...; 67] be column vectors (note that we use 0 instead of b,). Then Equation|8lis:

H = [Loexp(L[BoL’)) Z 0 Hl (9)

where L, L’ € R?** are lower and strictly lower triangular matrices of 1’s, respectively, o is elementwise multiplication, and B is a matrix where T’ b’s are tiled across the column, i.e. B = [b,..., b] €
R?*7, and similarly Z = [z,...,z] € R’*4%. All implicit operations are matrix multiplications.
With reasonable N (batch size), d and T (e.g. N,d, 7’ = 100), matrix operations in Equation|9|can
be comfortably computed in most modern GPUs.

4 RELATED WORK

QRN is inspired by RNN-based models with gating mechanism, such as LSTM
and GRU (Cho et al.|/2014). While GRU and LSTM use the previous hidden
state and the current input to obtain the candidate hidden state, QRN only uses the current two inputs
to obtain the candidate reduced query (equivalent to candidate hidden state). We conjecture that
this not only gives computational advantage via parallelization, but also makes training easier, 1.e.,
avoiding vanishing gradient (which is critical for long-term dependency), overfitting (by simplifying
the model), and converging to local minima.

The idea of structurally simplifying (constraining) RNNs for learning longer-term patterns has been
explored in recent previous work, such as Structurally Constrained Recurrent Network (Mikolov
and Strongly-Typed Recurrent Neural Network (STRNN) (Balduzzi and Ghifary||2016).
QRN is similar to STRNN in that both architectures use gating mechanism, and the gates and the
candidate hidden states do not depend on the previous hidden states, which simplifies the recurrent
relation. However, QRN can be distinguished from STRNN in three ways. First, QRN’s update
gate simulates attention mechanism, measuring the relevance between the input sentence and query.
On the other hand, the gates in STRNN can be considered as the simplification of LSTM/GRU
by removing their dependency on previous hidden state. Second, QRN is an RNN that is natively
compatible with context-based QA tasks, where the QRN unit accepts two inputs, i.e. each context
sentence and query. This is distinct from STRNN which has only one input. Third, we show that
QRN is timewise-parallelizable on GPUs. Our parallelization algorithm is also applicable to STRNN.

End-to-end Memory Network (N2N) (Sukhbaatar et al.}/2015) uses external memory with multi-layer

attention mechanism to focus on sentences that are relevant to the question. There are two key
differences between N2N and our QRN. First, N2N summarizes the entire memory in each layer
to control the attention in the next layer (circle nodes in Figure [2b). Instead, QRN does not have
any controller node (Figure[2ap and is able to focus on relevant sentences through the update gate
that is internally embodied within its unit. Second, N2N adds time-dependent trainable weights
to the sentence representations to model the time dependency of the sentences (as discussed in
Section|I). QRN does not need such additional weights as its inherent RNN architecture allows QRN
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

 

to effectively model the time dependency. Neural Reasoner (Peng et al.}|2015) and Gated End-toend Memory Network (Perez and Liu}|2016)) are variants of MemN2N that share its fundamental

characteristics.

Improved Dynamic Memory Network (DMN+) (Xiong et al.|}2016) uses the hybrid of the attention
mechanism and the RNN architecture to model the sequence of sentences. It consists of two distinct

GRUs, one for the time axis (rectangle nodes in Figure[2ch and one for the layer axis (circle nodes in
Figure|2c). Note that the update gate of the GRU for the time axis 1s replaced with external softmax
attention weights. DMN+ uses the time-axis GRU to summarizes the entire memory in each layer,
and then the layer-axis GRU controls the attention weights in each layer. In contrast, QRN is simply
a single recurrent unit without any controller node.

5 EXPERIMENTS

5.1 DATA

bADI story-based QA dataset bAbI story-based QA dataset 2016) is composed of
20 different tasks (Appendix [Ap, each of which has 1,000 (1k) synthetically-generated story-question

pair. A story can be as short as two sentences and as long as 200+ sentences. A system is evaluated
on the accuracy of getting the correct answers to the questions. The answers are single words or
lists (e.g. “football, apple’). Answering questions in each task requires selecting a set of relevant
sentences and applying different kinds of logical reasoning over them. The dataset also includes 10k
training data (for each task), which allows training more complex models. Note that DMN+

2016) only reports on the 10k dataset.
bAbI dialog dataset bAbI dialog dataset (Bordes and Weston}|2016) consists of 5 different tasks

(Table (3), each of which has 1k synthetically-generated goal-oriented dialogs between a user and the
system in the domain of restaurant reservation. Each dialog is as long as 96 utterances and comes with
external knowledge base (KB) providing information of each restaurant. The authors also provide
Out-Of- Vocabulary (OOV) version of the dataset, where many of the words and KB keywords in
test data are not seen during training. A system is evaluated on the accuracy of its response to each
utterance of the user, choosing from up to 2500 possible candidate responses. A system is required
not only to understand the user’s request but also refer to previous conversations in order to obtain
the context information of the current conversation.

DSTC2 (Task 6) dialog dataset (2016) transformed the Second Dialog State
Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) dataset (Henderson et al.||2014) into the same format as the bAbI
dialog dataset, for the measurement of performance on a real dataset. Each dialog can be as long
as 800+ utterances, and a system needs to choose from 2407 possible candidate responses for each
utterance of the user. Note that the evaluation metric of the original DSTC2 is different from that of
the transformed DSTC2, so previous work on the original DSTC2 should not be directly compared to
our work. We will refer to this transformed DSTC2 dataset by “Task 6” of dialog dataset.

5.2 MODEL DETAILS

Input Module. In the input module, we are given sentences (previous conversations in dialog) x;
and a question (most recent user utterance) g, and we want to obtain their vector representations,
x;,q € R®. We use a trainable embedding matrix A € R?*” to encode the one-hot vector of each
word x; in each sentence x; into a d-dimensional vector x;; € IR®. Then the sentence representation

x, 1s obtained by Position Encoder (Weston et al.|}2015). The same encoder with the same embedding
matrix is also used to obtain the question vector q from q.

Output Module for story-based QA. In the output module, we are given the vector representation
of the predicted answer y and we want to obtain the natural language form of the answer, y.
We use a V-way single-layer softmax classifier to map y to a V-dimensional sparse vector, Vv =
softmax (Wy) € RY, where W\) € RY*¢ is a weight matrix. Then the final answer @ is
simply the argmax word in Vv. To handle questions with multiple-word answers, we consider each
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

 

of them as a single word that contains punctuations such as space and comma, and put it in the
vocabulary.

Output Module for dialog. We use a fixed number single-layer softmax classifiers, each of which
is similar to that of the sotry-based QA model, to sequentially output each word of the system’s
response. While it is similar in spirit to the RNN decoder (Cho et al.|/2014), our output module does
not have a recurrent hidden state or gating mechanism. Instead, it solely uses the final ouptut of the
QRN, y, and the current word output to influence the prediction of the next word among possible
candidates.

Training. We withhold 10% of the training for development. We use the hidden state size of 50 by
deafult. Batch sizes of 32 for bAbI story-based QA 1k, bAbI dialog and DSTC2 dialog, and 128 for
bAbI QA 10k are used. The weights in the input and output modules are initialized with zero mean
and the standard deviation of 1/ Vd. Weights in the QRN unit are initialized using techniques by
(Glorot and Bengio|(2010), and are tied across the layers. Forget bias of 2.5 is used for update gates
(no bias for reset gates). L2 weight decay of 0.001 (0.0005 for QA 10k) is used for all weights. The
loss function is the cross entropy between v and the one-hot vector of the true answer. The loss is
minimized by stochastic gradient descent for maximally 500 epochs, but training is early stopped if
the loss on the development data does not decrease for 50 epochs. The learning rate is controlled by
AdaGrad with the initial learning rate of 0.5 (0.1 for QA 10k). Since the model
is sensitive to the weight initialization, we repeat each training procedure 10 times (50 times for 10k)
with the new random initialization of the weights and report the result on the test data with the lowest
loss on the development data.

5.3. RESULTS.

We compare our model with baselines and previous state-of-the-art models on story-based and dialog

tasks (Table[I). These include LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber}|1997), End-to-end Memory
Networks (N2N) (Sukhbaatar et al.}/2015), Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN+) (Xiong et al.}|2016),
Gated End-to-end Memory Networks (GMemN2N) 2016), and Differentiable Neural

Computer (DNC) 2016).

Story-based QA. Table [I{top) reports the summary of results of our model (QRN) and previous
work on bAbI QA (task-wise results are shown in Table[2]in Appendix). In 1k data, QRN’s ‘2r’ (2
layers + reset gate + d = 50) outperforms all other models by a large margin (2.8+%). In 10k dataset,
the average accuracy of QRN’s “6r200’ (6 layers + reset gate + d = 200) model outperforms all
previous models by a large margin (2.5+%), achieving a nearly perfect score of 99.7%.

Dialog. Table [I{ bottom) reports the summary of the results of our model (QRN) and previous work
on bAbI dialog and Task 6 dialog (task-wise results are shown in Table[3]in Appendix). As done in
previous work (Bordes and Weston}|2016}|Perez and Liu}/2016), we also report results when we use
‘Match’ for dialogs. ‘Match’ is the extension to the model which additionally takes as input whether
each answer candidate matches with context (more details on Appendix). QRN outperforms previous
work by a large margin (2.0+%) in every comparison.

Ablations. We test four types of ablations (also discussed in Section [2.2): number of layers (1,
2, 3, or 6), reset gate (r), and gate vectorization (v) and the dimension of the hidden vector (50,
100). We show a subset of combinations of the ablations for bAbI QA in Table [1] and Table [2}
other combinations performed poorly and/or did not give interesting observations. According to the
ablation results, we infer that: (a) When the number of layers is only one, the model lacks reasoning
capability. In the case of 1k dataset, when there are too many layers (6), it seems correctly training
the model becomes increasingly difficult. In the case of 10k dataset, many layers (6) and hidden
dimensions (200) helps reasoning, most notably in difficult task such as task 16. (b) Adding the reset
gate helps. (c) Including vector gates hurts in 1k datasets, as the model either overfits to the training
data or converges to local minima. On the other hand, vector gates in bAbI story-based QA 10k
dataset sometimes help. (d) Increasing the dimension of the hidden state to 100 in the dialog’s Task 6
(DSTC2) helps, while there is not much improvement in the dialog’s Task 1-5. It can be hypothesized
that a larger hidden state is required for real data.

Parallelization. We implement QRN with and without parallelization in TensorFlow
on a single Titan X GPU to qunaitify the computational gain of the parallelization. For QRN
without parallelization, we use the RNN library provided by TensorFlow. QRN with parallelization
gives 6.2 times faster training and inference than QRN without parallelization on average. We expect
that the speedup can be even higher for datasets with larger context.

Interpretations. An advantage of QRN is that the intermediate query updates are interpretable.
Figure|1|shows intermediate local queries (q‘’) interpreted in natural language, such as “Where is
Sandra?’. In order to obtain these, we place a decoder on the input question embedding q and add
its loss for recovering the question to the classification loss (similarly to|Peng et al.|(2015)). We
then use the same decoder to decode the intermediate queries. This helps us understand the flow of
information in the networks. In Figure[I| the question Where is apple? is transformed into
Where is Sandra? att=1. Att=2,as Sandra dropped the apple, the apple is no
more relevant to Sandra. We obtainWhere is Daniel? attimet = 3, and it is propagated until
t = 5, where we observe a sentence (fact) that can be used to answer the query.

Visualization. Figure[3]shows vizualization of the (scalar) magnitudes of update and reset gates on
story sentences and dialog utterances. More visualizations are shown in Appendices: Figure|4]and
Figure[5] In Figure[3} we observe high values on facts that provide information to answer question
(the system’s next utterance for dialog). In QA Task 2 example (top left), we observe high update
gate values in the first layer on facts that state who has the apple, and in the second layer, the high
update gate values are on those that inform where that person went to. We also observe that the
forward reset gate at ¢ = 2 in the first layer (773) is low, which is signifying that apple no more

belongs to Sandra. In dialog Task 3 (bottom left), the model is able to infer that three restaurants
are already recommended so that it can recommend another one. In dialog Task 6 (bottom), the model
focuses on the sentences containing Spanish, and does not concentrate much on other facts such as
I don’t care.

6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we introduce Query-Reduction Network (QRN) to answer context-based questions
and carry out conversations with users that require multi-hop reasoning. We show the state-of-theart results in the three datasets of story-based QA and dialog. We model a story or a dialog as a
sequence of state-changing triggers and compute the final answer to the question or the system’s next
utterance by recurrently updating (or reducing) the query. QRN is situated between the attention
mechanism and RNN, effectively handling time dependency and long-term dependency problems
of each technique, respectively. It addresses the long-term dependency problem of most RNNs by
simplifying the recurrent update, in which the candidate hidden state (reduced query) does not depend
on the previous state. Moreover, QRN can be parallelized and can address the well-known problem
of RNN’s vanishing gradients.

B VECTOR GATE PARALLELIZATION

For vector gates, we have z; € IR? instead of z € R. Therefore the following equation replaces
Equation[7|

init log (1 — z;")

t 2
__;1 , log (1 — 2; ~
Tisverlog(l— a7) | | 40

t

h; = S exp
i=1 :

cet log (1 — 25°)

where z,;* is the k-th column vector of z;. Let b;; = log(1 — 2,1) for brevity. Then, we can rewrite
Equation|8|as following:

h} i 0 —oo —0oo Le. 00 Z 10 h]

hj bo; 0 —CO ewe —CO Z2Q 0 hy

hi — lexp bo; oP b3; bs; 0 ©, © Zz 0 hi (11)

- : r : r : : : : 
h7. Dk=2 Ok} = Dop—zOKi dopa dng «+. 0 zr oh;
Let H = [hj ;...;h] be a T-by-d matrix where the transposes (T) of the column vectors h, are
concatenated across row. We similarly define H from h;. Also, let z = [z1;...; zr], and Bg bea
T-by-T matrix where T [0; baa; ...; bra]’s are tiled across the column.
Then Equation|] iis:

[L o exp (L[B, o L’))| Z ° H
[L o exp (L [Bz o L’])| LZ ° Hl (12)

~ 7d
IL o exp (L[By 0 L’})] Z 6 Hl

where L, L’ € R?** are lower and strictly lower triangular matrices of 1’s are tiled across the
column. Z = [z1,...,Zq] € R?*?.

C MODEL DETAILS

Match. While similar in spirit, our ‘Match’ model is slightly different from previous work
2016} 2016). We use answer candidate embedding matrix, and

add 2 dimension of O-1 matrix which expresses whether the answer candidate matches with
any word in the paragraph and the question. In other words, the softmax is computed by
v = softmax (W[W“); M™]9) € RY, where W € R24 and W € RY*(4—2) are train
able weight matrices, and M) € RY <2 is the 0-1 match matrix.

Visualization of Dialog. Figure|5|shows visualization of models for dialog tasks.

In the first dialog of task 1, the model focuses on the user utterance that mentions the user’s desired
cuisine and location, and the current query (user’s last utterance) informs the system of the number of
people, so the system is able to learn that it now needs to ask the user about the desired price range.
In the second dialog of task 1, the model focuses on the facts that provide information about the
requests of the user. In task 4 (third), the model focuses on what restaurant a user is talking about and
the information about the restaurant.
