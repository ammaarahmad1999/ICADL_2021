(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||consists of||three modules)
(three modules||conduct||answer verification)
(answer verification||by enabling||each answer candidate)
(each answer candidate||to attend||other candidates)
(other candidates||based on||their representations)
(three modules||use||content scores)
(content scores||to measure||quality)
(quality||of||candidates)
(three modules||model||meanings)
(meanings||of||answer candidates)
(answer candidates||extracted from||those passages)
(three modules||follow||boundary - based MRC models)
(boundary - based MRC models||to find||answer candidate)
(answer candidate||by identifying||start and end position)
(start and end position||of||answer)
(answer candidate||for||each passage)
(Model||has||final answer)
(final answer||determined by||three factors)
(three factors||modeled using||different modules)
(different modules||can be||jointly trained)
(jointly trained||in||our end - to - end framework)
(three factors||has||boundary)
(three factors||has||content)
(three factors||has||crosspassage answer verification)
