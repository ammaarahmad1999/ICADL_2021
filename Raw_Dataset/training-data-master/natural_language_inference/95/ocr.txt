Abstract

Machine reading comprehension (MRC)
on real web data usually requires the machine to answer a question by analyzing
multiple passages retrieved by search engine. Compared with MRC on a single
passage, multi-passage MRC is more challenging, since we are likely to get multiple
confusing answer candidates from different passages. To address this problem, we
propose an end-to-end neural model that
enables those answer candidates from different passages to verify each other based
on their content representations. Specifically, we jointly train three modules that
can predict the final answer based on three
factors: the answer boundary, the answer
content and the cross-passage answer verification. The experimental results show
that our method outperforms the baseline by a large margin and achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the English MS-MARCO dataset and the Chinese DuReader dataset, both of which are
designed for MRC in real-world settings.

1 Introduction

Machine reading comprehension (MRC), empowering computers with the ability to acquire know!edge and answer questions from textual data, is
believed to be a crucial step in building a general
intelligent agent (Chen et al., 2016). Recent years
have seen rapid growth in the MRC community.
With the release of various datasets, the MRC task
has evolved from the early cloze-style test (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015) to answer extraction from a single passage (Rajpurkar et al.,

“This work was done while the first author was doing internship at Baidu Inc.

2016) and to the latest more complex question answering on web data (Nguyen et al., 2016; Dunn
et al., 2017; He et al., 2017).

Great efforts have also been made to develop
models for these MRC tasks , especially for the
answer extraction on single passage (Wang and
Jiang, 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2017).
A significant milestone is that several MRC models have exceeded the performance of human annotators on the SQUAD dataset! (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016). However, this success on single Wikipedia
passage is still not adequate, considering the ultimate goal of reading the whole web. Therefore,
several latest datasets (Nguyen et al., 2016; He
et al., 2017; Dunn et al., 2017) attempt to design
the MRC tasks in more realistic settings by involving search engines. For each question, they use the
search engine to retrieve multiple passages and the
MRC models are required to read these passages
in order to give the final answer.

One of the intrinsic challenges for such multipassage MRC is that since all the passages are
question-related but usually independently written, it’s probable that multiple confusing answer
candidates (correct or incorrect) exist. Table |
shows an example from MS-MARCO. We can
see that all the answer candidates have semantic
matching with the question while they are literally
different and some of them are even incorrect. As
is shown by Jia and Liang (2017), these confusing answer candidates could be quite difficult for
MRC models to distinguish. Therefore, special
consideration is required for such multi-passage
MRC problem.

In this paper, we propose to leverage the answer candidates from different passages to verify
the final correct answer and rule out the noisy incorrect answers. Our hypothesis is that the cor

Table 1: An example from MS-MARCO. The text in bold is the predicted answer candidate from each
passage according to the boundary model. The candidate from [1] is chosen as the final answer by this

model, while the correct answer is from [6] and can be verified by the answers from [3], [4], [5].

rect answers could occur more frequently in those
passages and usually share some commonalities,
while incorrect answers are usually different from
one another. The example in Table 1 demonstrates
this phenomenon. We can see that the answer candidates extracted from the last four passages are all
valid answers to the question and they are semantically similar to each other, while the answer candidates from the other two passages are incorrect and
there is no supportive information from other passages. As human beings usually compare the answer candidates from different sources to deduce
the final answer, we hope that MRC model can
also benefit from the cross-passage answer verification process.

The overall framework of our model is demonstrated in Figure | , which consists of three modules. First, we follow the boundary-based MRC
models (Seo et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016)
to find an answer candidate for each passage by
identifying the start and end position of the answer (Figure 2). Second, we model the meanings of the answer candidates extracted from those
passages and use the content scores to measure
the quality of the candidates from a second perspective. Third, we conduct the answer verification by enabling each answer candidate to attend
to the other candidates based on their representations. We hope that the answer candidates can
collect supportive information from each other according to their semantic similarities and further
decide whether each candidate is correct or not.

Therefore, the final answer is determined by three
factors: the boundary, the content and the crosspassage answer verification. The three steps are
modeled using different modules, which can be
jointly trained in our end-to-end framework.

We conduct extensive experiments on the MSMARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) and DuReader (He
et al., 2017) datasets. The results show that our
answer verification MRC model outperforms the
baseline models by a large margin and achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

2 Our Approach

Figure | gives an overview of our multi-passage
MRC model which is mainly composed of three
modules including answer boundary prediction,
answer content modeling and answer verification.
First of all, we need to model the question and
passages. Following Seo et al. (2016), we compute the question-aware representation for each
passage (Section 2.1). Based on this representation, we employ a Pointer Network (Vinyals et al.,
2015) to predict the start and end position of the
answer in the module of answer boundary prediction (Section 2.2). At the same time, with the
answer content model (Section 2.3), we estimate
whether each word should be included in the answer and thus obtain the answer representations.
Next, in the answer verification module (Section
2.4), each answer candidate can attend to the other
answer candidates to collect supportive information and we compute one score for each candidate

to indicate whether it is correct or not according to
the verification. The final answer is determined by
not only the boundary but also the answer content
and its verification score (Section 2.5).

2.1 Question and Passage Modeling

Given a question Q and a set of passages {P;} retrieved by search engines, our task is to find the
best concise answer to the question. First, we formally present the details of modeling the question
and passages.

Encoding We first map each word into the vector space by concatenating its word embedding
and sum of its character embeddings. Then we
employ bi-directional LSTMs (BiLSTM) to encode the question Q and passages {P;; } as follows:

ue = BiLSTMg(u,, ler’, c¥’]) (1)
ui; = BiLSTMp(ut",, le; ', cf ']) (2)

where e” , ce , e; . Cc} * are the word-level and

character-level embeddings of the t’” word. ue
and ui) ‘ are the encoding vectors of the t*” words
in Q and P; respectively. Unlike previous work
(Wang et al., 2017c) that simply concatenates all
the passages, we process the passages indepen
dently at the encoding and matching steps.

Q-P Matching One essential step in MRC is to
match the question with passages so that important information can be highlighted. We use the

Attention Flow Layer (Seo et al., 2016) to conduct
the Q-P matching in two directions. The similarity matrix S € R!Q!*!P:! between the question and
passage 7 is changed to a simpler version, where
the similarity between the t”” word in the question
and the k“” word in passage i is computed as:

Sip =u?! - ui! (3)

Then the context-to-question attention and
question-to-context attention is applied strictly
following Seo et al. (2016) to obtain the questionaware passage representation {ay ‘\. We do not
give the details here due to space limitation. Next,
another BiLSTM is applied in order to fuse the
contextual information and get the new representation for each word in the passage, which is regarded as the match output:

v;' = BiLSTMy(v}",, 0) (4)

Based on the passage representations, we introduce the three main modules of our model.

2.2 Answer Boundary Prediction

To extract the answer span from passages, mainstream studies try to locate the boundary of the answer, which is called boundary model. Following
(Wang and Jiang, 2016), we employ Pointer Network (Vinyals et al., 2015) to compute the probability of each word to be the start or end position
of the span:

Jk = wi" fanh(W2 ms shy 4) (5)

ah, = exp(gh yo" _exp(j) (6)
[P|

Cc = a \ avi (7)

h? = LSTM(h?_,, cz) (8)

By utilizing the attention weights, the probability of the k*” word in the passage to be the start and
end position of the answer is obtained as Quy, and
ae. It should be noted that the pointer network is
applied to the concatenation of all passages, which
is denoted as P so that the probabilities are comparable across passages. This boundary model can
be trained by minimizing the negative log probabilities of the true start and end indices:

N

1
=-> S (log ou + log a2) (9)

i=1

Lhoundery

where NV is the number of samples in the dataset
and Yr y? are the gold start and end positions.

2.3 Answer Content Modeling

Previous work employs the boundary model to
find the text span with the maximum boundary
score as the final answer. However, in our context,
besides locating the answer candidates, we also
need to model their meanings in order to conduct
the verification. An intuitive method is to compute
the representation of the answer candidates separately after extracting them, but it could be hard to
train such model end-to-end. Here, we propose a
novel method that can obtain the representation of
the answer candidates based on probabilities.
Specifically, we change the output layer of
the classic MRC model. Besides predicting the
boundary probabilities for the words in the passages, we also predict whether each word should
be included in the content of the answer. The content probability of the k“” word is computed as:
py, = sigmoid(w “TReLU(W5Sv7' )) (10)
Training this content model is also quite intuitive. We transform the boundary labels into a continuous segment, which means the words within
the answer span will be labeled as 1 and other
words will be labeled as 0. In this way, we define

the loss function as the averaged cross entropy:

N |P|

-= P] ~S~S\ yf log pf

1=1 g=1

Loontent =

(11)
+ (1 — yf) log(1 — pz)

The content probabilities provide another view
to measure the quality of the answer in addition to
the boundary. Moreover, with these probabilities,
we can represent the answer from passage 7 as a
weighted sum of all the word embeddings in this
passage:

 

|P;| P; _P;
a Ele) o2

2.4 Cross-Passage Answer Verification

The boundary model and the content model focus
on extracting and modeling the answer within a
single passage respectively, with little consideration of the cross-passage information. However,
as 1s discussed in Section 1, there could be multiple answer candidates from different passages
and some of them may mislead the MRC model
to make an incorrect prediction. It’s necessary to
aggregate the information from different passages
and choose the best one from those candidates.
Therefore, we propose a method to enable the answer candidates to exchange information and verify each other through the cross-passage answer
verification process.

Given the representation of the answer candidates from all passages {r“*}, each answer candidate then attends to other candidates to collect
supportive information via attention mechanism:

0, a)
a 13
tJ we -r43, otherwise ”
= exp(s;,; Yn. , &XP( Sik) (14)
~A; __ A;
MAT owe as)

Here £4: is the collected verification informa
tion from other passages based on the attention
weights. Then we pass it together with the original representation r“: to a fully connected layer:

Vv A;

g? = wT rt FA rt OF] (16)

We further normalize these scores over all passages to get the verification score for answer can
didate A;:
= exp(g;)/ 1 (17)

exp(g; )
In order to train this verification model, we take
the answer from the gold passage as the gold answer. And the loss function can be formulated as
the negative log probability of the correct answer:

N
1
Luerify — N Ss” log Py (18)
i=l
where y,’ is the index of the correct answer in all
the answer candidates of the 7” instance .

2.5 Joint Training and Prediction

As is described above, we define three objectives
for the reading comprehension model over multiple passages: 1. finding the boundary of the answer; 2. predicting whether each word should be
included in the content; 3. selecting the best answer via cross-passage answer verification. According to our design, these three tasks can share
the same embedding, encoding and matching layers. Therefore, we propose to train them together
as multi-task learning (Ruder, 2017). The joint objective function is formulated as follows:

L= Choundery + Bi L content + Bole wepi ty (19)

where (; and (2 are two hyper-parameters that
control the weights of those tasks.

When predicting the final answer, we take the
boundary score, content score and verification
score into consideration. We first extract the answer candidate A; that has the maximum boundary
score from each passage 7. This boundary score is
computed as the product of the start and end probability of the answer span. Then for each answer
candidate A;, we average the content probabilities
of all its words as the content score of A;. And we
can also predict the verification score for A; using
the verification model. Therefore, the final answer
can be selected from all the answer candidates according to the product of these three scores.

3 Experiments

To verify the effectiveness of our model on multipassage machine reading comprehension, we conduct experiments on the MS-MARCO (Nguyen
et al., 2016) and DuReader (He et al., 2017)
datasets. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on both datasets.

3.1 Datasets

We choose the MS-MARCO and DuReader
datasets to test our method, since both of them are

| MS-MARCO

 

Multiple Answers 9.93% 67.28%
Multiple Spans 40.00% 56.38%

Table 2: Percentage of questions that have multiple valid answers or answer spans

designed from real-world search engines and involve a large number of passages retrieved from
the web. One difference of these two datasets is
that MS-MARCO mainly focuses on the English
web data, while DuReader is designed for Chinese
MRC. This diversity is expected to reflect the generality of our method. In terms of the data size,
MS-MARCO contains 102023 questions, each of
which is paired up with approximately 10 passages
for reading comprehension. As for DuReader, it
keeps the top-5 search results for each question
and there are totally 201574 questions.

One prerequisite for answer verification is that
there should be multiple correct answers so that
they can verify each other. Both the MS-MARCO
and DuReader datasets require the human annotators to generate multiple answers if possible. Table 2 shows the proportion of questions that have
multiple answers. However, the same answer that
occurs many times is treated as one single answer here. Therefore, we also report the proportion of questions that have multiple answer spans
to match with the human-generated answers. A
span is taken as valid if it can achieve Fl score
larger than 0.7 compared with any reference answer. From these statistics, we can see that the
phenomenon of multiple answers is quite common
for both MS-MARCO and DuReader. These answers will provide strong signals for answer verification if we can leverage them properly.

3.2 Implementation Details

For MS-MARCO, we preprocess the corpus with
the reversible tokenizer from Stanford CoreNLP
(Manning et al., 2014) and we choose the span that
achieves the highest ROUGE-L score with the reference answers as the gold span for training. We
employ the 300-D pre-trained Glove embeddings
(Pennington et al., 2014) and keep it fixed during training. The character embeddings are randomly initialized with its dimension as 30. For
DuReader, we follow the preprocessing described
in He et al. (2017).

We tune the hyper-parameters according to the

and we apply £2 regularization with its weight as
0.0003. The task weights 6), 2 are both set to
be 0.5. To train our model, we employ the Adam
algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with the initial
learning rate as 0.0004 and the mini-batch size as
32. Exponential moving average is applied on all
trainable variables with a decay rate 0.9999.

Two simple yet effective technologies are employed to improve the final performance on these
two datasets respectively. For MS-MARCO, approximately 8% questions have the answers as Yes
or No, which usually cannot be solved by extractive approach (Tan et al., 2017). We address
this problem by training a simple Yes/No classifier for those questions with certain patterns (e.g.,
starting with “‘is’’). Concretely, we simply change
the output layer of the basic boundary model so
that it can predict whether the answer is “Yes”
or “No”. For DuReader, the retrieved document
usually contains a large number of paragraphs that
cannot be fed into MRC models directly (He et al.,
2017). The original paper employs a simple a
simple heuristic strategy to select a representative
paragraph for each document, while we train a
paragraph ranking model for this. We will demonstrate the effects of these two technologies later.

3.3. Results on MS-MARCO

Table 3 shows the results of our system and other
state-of-the-art models on the MS-MARCO test
set. We adopt the official evaluation metrics, including ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and BLEU-1 (Papineni et al., 2002). As we can see, for both metrics, our single model outperforms all the other
competing models with an evident margin, which
is extremely hard considering the near-human per

terms of the BLEU-1.

3.4 Results on DuReader

The results of our model and several baseline systems on the test set of DuReader are shown in
Table 4. The BiDAF and Match-LSTM models
are provided as two baseline systems (He et al.,
2017). Based on BiDAF, as is described in Section
3.2, we tried a new paragraph selection strategy
by employing a paragraph ranking (PR) model.
We can see that this paragraph ranking can boost
the BiDAF baseline significantly. Finally, we implement our system based on this new strategy,
and our system (single model) achieves further improvement by a large margin.

candidate [1] gets high boundary and content scores, the correct answer [6] is preferred by the verification

model and is chosen as the final answer.

4 Analysis and Discussion

4.1 Ablation Study

To get better insight into our system, we conduct
in-depth ablation study on the development set of
MS-MARCO, which is shown in Table 5. Following Tan et al. (2017), we mainly focus on the
ROUGE-L score that is averaged case by case.
We first evaluate the answer verification by ablating the cross-passage verification model so that
the verification loss and verification score will not
be used during training and testing. Then we remove the content model in order to test the necessity of modeling the content of the answer.
Since we don’t have the content scores, we use the
boundary probabilities instead to compute the answer representation for verification. Next, to show
the benefits of joint training, we train the boundary model separately from the other two models.
Finally, we remove the yes/no classification in order to show the real improvement of our end-toend model compared with the baseline method that
predicts the answer with only the boundary model.
From Table 5, we can see that the answer verification makes a great contribution to the overall
improvement, which confirms our hypothesis that
cross-passage answer verification is useful for the
multi-passage MRC. For the ablation of the content model, we analyze that it will not only affect the content score itself, but also violate the
verification model since the content probabilities
are necessary for the answer representation, which
will be further analyzed in Section 4.3. Another
discovery is that jointly training the three models can provide great benefits, which shows that
the three tasks are actually closely related and can
boost each other with shared representations at
bottom layers. At last, comparing our method with
the baseline, we achieve an improvement of nearly

3 points without the yes/no classification. This
significant improvement proves the effectiveness
of our approach.

4.2 Case Study

To demonstrate how each module of our model
takes effect when predicting the final answer, we
conduct a case study in Table 6 with the same example that we discussed in Section |. For each
answer candidate, we list three scores predicted
by the boundary model, content model and verification model respectively.

On the one hand, we can see that these three
scores generally have some relevance. For example, the second candidate is given lowest scores
by all the three models. We analyze that this is
because the models share the same encoding and
matching layers at bottom level and this relevance
guarantees that the content and verification models will not violate the boundary model too much.
On the other hand, we also see that the verification score can really make a difference here when
the boundary model makes an incorrect decision
among the confusing answer candidates ({1], [3],
[4], [6]). Besides, as we expected, the verification model tends to give higher scores for those answers that have semantic commonality with each
other ({3], [4], [6]), which are all valid answers
in this case. By multiplying the three scores, our
model finally predicts the answer correctly.

4.3. Necessity of the Content Model

In our model, we compute the answer representation based on the content probabilities predicted
by a separate content model instead of directly using the boundary probabilities. We argue that this
content model is necessary for our answer verification process. Figure 2 plots the predicted content
probabilities as well as the boundary probabilities

Figure 2: The boundary probabilities and content probabilities for the words in a passage

for a passage. We can see that the boundary and
content probabilities capture different aspects of
the answer. Since answer candidates usually have
similar boundary words, if we compute the answer representation based on the boundary probabilities, it’s difficult to model the real difference
among different answer candidates. On the contrary, with the content probabilities, we pay more
attention to the content part of the answer, which
can provide more distinguishable information for
verifying the correct answer. Furthermore, the
content probabilities can also adjust the weights of
the words within the answer span so that unimportant words (e.g. “and” and “.’) get lower weights
in the final answer representation. We believe that
this refined representation is also good for the answer verification process.

5 Related Work

Machine reading comprehension made rapid
progress in recent years, especially for singlepassage MRC task, such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016). Mainstream studies (Seo et al., 2016;
Wang and Jiang, 2016; Xiong et al., 2016) treat
reading comprehension as extracting answer span
from the given passage, which is usually achieved
by predicting the start and end position of the answer. We implement our boundary model similarly by employing the boundary-based pointer
network (Wang and Jiang, 2016). Another inspiring work is from Wang et al. (2017c), where the
authors propose to match the passage against itself so that the representation can aggregate evidence from the whole passage. Our verification
model adopts a similar idea. However, we collect
information across passages and our attention is
based on the answer representation, which is much
more efficient than attention over all passages. For
the model training, Xiong et al. (2017) argues that
the boundary loss encourages exact answers at the

cost of penalizing overlapping answers. Therefore they propose a mixed objective that incorporates rewards derived from word overlap. Our joint
training approach has a similar function. By taking the content and verification loss into consideration, our model will give less loss for overlapping answers than those unmatched answers, and
our loss function is totally differentiable.
Recently, we also see emerging interests in
multi-passage MRC from both the academic
(Dunn et al., 2017; Joshi et al., 2017) and industrial community (Nguyen et al., 2016; He et al.,
2017). Early studies (Shen et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2017c) usually concat those passages and
employ the same models designed for singlepassage MRC. However, more and more latest
studies start to design specific methods that can
read multiple passages more effectively. In the aspect of passage selection, Wang et al. (2017a) introduced a pipelined approach that rank the passages first and then read the selected passages
for answering questions. Tan et al. (2017) treats
the passage ranking as an auxiliary task that can
be trained jointly with the reading comprehension
model. Actually, the target of our answer verification is very similar to that of the passage selection, while we pay more attention to the answer content and the answer verification process.
Speaking of the answer verification, Wang et al.
(2017b) has a similar motivation to ours. They
attempt to aggregate the evidence from different
passages and choose the final answer from n-best
candidates. However, they implement their idea as
a separate reranking step after reading comprehension, while our answer verification is a component
of the whole model that can be trained end-to-end.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to tackle the multi-passage MRC task . We
creatively design three different modules in our
model, which can find the answer boundary, model
the answer content and conduct cross-passage answer verification respectively. All these three
modules can be trained with different forms of the
answer labels and training them jointly can provide further improvement. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the
baseline models by a large margin and achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, both of which are designed for MRC
on real web data.
