(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||named||Fully Attention - Based Information Retriever ( FABIR ))
(Model||to verify||how much performance)
(how much performance||get exclusively from||attention mechanism)
(attention mechanism||without combining it with||several other techniques)
(Model||has||Convolutional attention)
(Convolutional attention||has||novel attention mechanism)
(novel attention mechanism||encodes||many - to - many relationships)
(many - to - many relationships||enabling||richer contextual representations)
(many - to - many relationships||between||words)
(Model||has||Reduction layer)
(Reduction layer||has||new layer design)
(new layer design||fits||pipeline)
(pipeline||proposed by||Vaswani et al .)
(Model||has||Column - wise cross - attention)
(Column - wise cross - attention||modify||crossattention operation)
(Column - wise cross - attention||propose||new technique)
(new technique||better suited to||question - answering)
