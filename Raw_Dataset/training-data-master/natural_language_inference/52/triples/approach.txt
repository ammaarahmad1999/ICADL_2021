(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||that||learns)
(learns||to||select and explain answers)
(learns||when||only supervision available)
(only supervision available||is||which answer is correct)
(which answer is correct||not||how to explain it)
(Approach||chooses||justifications)
(justifications||that provide||most help)
(most help||towards||ranking)
(ranking||has||correct answers)
(correct answers||has||higher)
(higher||than||incorrect ones)
(Approach||formally||our neural network approach)
(our neural network approach||has||alternates)
(alternates||using||current model)
(current model||with||max - pooling)
(current model||to choose||highest scoring justifications)
(highest scoring justifications||for||correct answers)
(alternates||optimizing||answer ranking model)
(answer ranking model||given||justifications)
