(Results||Of||two RNN models)
(two RNN models||has||LSTM 's)
(LSTM 's||has||more robust ability)
(more robust ability||serves||well)
(more robust ability||resulting in||performance)
(performance||that is||essentially equivalent)
(essentially equivalent||to||lexicalized classifier)
(lexicalized classifier||on||test set)
(more robust ability||to learn||long - term dependencies)
(Results||has||sum of words model)
(sum of words model||performed||slightly worse)
(slightly worse||than||fundamentally similar lexicalized classifier)
(Results||has||gap)
(gap||between||train and test set accuracy)
(train and test set accuracy||is||relatively small)
(relatively small||for||all three neural network models)
(Results||has||somewhat steeper slope)
(somewhat steeper slope||for||LSTM)
(somewhat steeper slope||hints that||ability to learn)
(ability to learn||has||arbitrarily structured representations)
(arbitrarily structured representations||give it||advantage)
(advantage||over||more constrained lexicalized model)
(more constrained lexicalized model||on||larger datasets)
(arbitrarily structured representations||of||sentence meaning)
