(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||rely on||self - attention mechanism)
(self - attention mechanism||directly draws||global dependencies)
(global dependencies||of||inputs)
(Model||major advantage of||self - attention)
(self - attention||provides||more flexible way)
(more flexible way||to select , represent and synthesize||information)
(information||of||inputs)
(information||complementary to||RNN based models)
(self - attention||conducts||direct connections)
(direct connections||between||two arbitrary tokens)
(two arbitrary tokens||in||sentence)
(self - attention||has||distant elements)
(distant elements||can interact with||each other)
(each other||allows||unimpeded information flow)
(unimpeded information flow||through||network)
(each other||by||shorter paths)
(Model||Along with||self - attention)
(self - attention||has||DEEP - ATT)
(DEEP - ATT||comes with||three variants)
(three variants||to further enhance||representations)
(representations||uses||recurrent ( RNN ))
(representations||uses||convolutional ( CNN ))
(representations||uses||feed - forward ( FFN ) neural network)
(Model||present||deep attentional neural network ( DEEPATT ))
(deep attentional neural network ( DEEPATT )||for||SRL)
