(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||builds on||recent coreference resolution model)
(recent coreference resolution model||by making||central)
(central||use of||learned , contextualized span representations)
(Model||use||representations)
(representations||to predict||SRL graphs)
(SRL graphs||directly over||text spans)
(Model||is||first span - based SRL model)
(first span - based SRL model||that does not assume||predicates are given)
(Model||has||final graph)
(final graph||union of||predicted SRL roles ( edges ))
(final graph||union of||associated text spans ( nodes ))
(Model||has||span representations)
(span representations||generalize||token - level representations)
(token - level representations||in||BIObased models)
(token - level representations||letting||model)
(model||dynamically decide||which spans and roles to include)
(which spans and roles to include||without using||previously standard syntactic features)
(Model||has||Each edge)
(Each edge||identified by||independently predicting)
(independently predicting||which||role)
(role||holds between||every possible pair of text spans)
(Model||propose||end - to - end approach)
(end - to - end approach||in||one forward pass)
(one forward pass||for predicting||all the predicates)
(one forward pass||for predicting||argument spans)
