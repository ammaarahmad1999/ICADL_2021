Inspired by recent successes of deep learning in computer vision, we propose
a novel application of deep convolutional neural networks to facial expression
recognition, in particular smile recognition. A smile recognition test accuracy
of 99.45% is achieved for the Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action
(DISFA) database, significantly outperforming existing approaches based on
hand-crafted features with accuracies ranging from 65.55% to 79.67%. The
novelty of this approach includes a comprehensive model selection of the architecture parameters, allowing to find an appropriate architecture for each
expression such as smile. This is feasible because all experiments were run on a
Tesla K40c GPU, allowing a speedup of factor 10 over traditional computations
on a CPU.

GPU acceleration.

1. Introduction

Neural networks are celebrating a comeback under the term ” deep learning” for the last ten years by training many hidden layers allowing to selflearn complex feature hierarchies. This makes them of particular interest
for computer vision, in which feature description is a long-standing issue.
Many advances have been reported in this period, including new training
methods and a paradigm shift of training from CPUs to GPUs. As a result,
those advances allow to train more reliable models much faster. This has
for example resulted in breakthroughs® in signal processing. Nonetheless,
deep neural networks are not a magic bullet and successful training is still
heavily based on experimentation.

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS)! is a system to taxonomize
any facial expression of a human being by their appearance on the face.
Action units describe muscles or muscle groups in the face, are set or unJuly 26, 2017 1:47 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in paper

set and the activation may be on different intensity levels. State-of-the art
approaches in this field mostly rely on hand-crafted features leaving a lot
of potential for higher accuracies. In contrast to other fields such as face or
gesture recognition, only very few works on deep learning applied to facial
expression recognition have been reported so far? in which the architecture
parameters are fixed. We are not aware of publications in which the architecture of a deep neural network for facial expression recognition is subject
to extensive model selection. This allows to learn appropriate architectures
per action unit.

2. Deep neural networks

Training neural networks is difficult, as their cost functions have many local minima. The more hidden layers, the more difficult the training of a
neural network. Hence, training tends to converge to a local minimum, resulting in poor generalization of the network. In order to overcome these
issues, a variety of new concepts have been proposed in the literature, of
which only a few can be named in this chapter. Unsupervised pre-training
methods, such as autoencoders® allow to initialize the weights well in order
for backpropagation to quickly optimize them. The Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU)’ and dropout!? are new regularization methods. The new training
methods and other new concepts can also lead to significant improvements
of shallow neural networks with just a few hidden layers. Convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) were initially proposed by LeCun? for the recognition of hand-written digits. A CNN consists of two layers: a convolutional
layer, followed by a subsampling layer. Inspired by biological processes and
exploiting the fact that nearby pixels are strongly correlated, CNNs are
relatively insensitive to small translations or rotations of the image input.

Training deep neural networks is slow due to the number of parameters
in the model. As the training can be described in a vectorized form, it is
possible to massively parallelize it. Modern GPUs have thousands of cores
and are therefore an ideal candidate for the execution of the training of
neural networks. Significant speedups of factor 10 or higher? have been
reported. A difficulty is to write GPU code. In the last few years, more
abstract libraries have been released.

3. DISFA database

The Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA)° database consists of 27 videos of 4844 frames each, with 130,788 images in total. Action
July 26, 2017 1:47 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in paper

unit annotations are on different levels of intensity, which are ignored in
the following experiments and action units are either set or unset. DISFA
was selected from a wider range of databases popular in the field of facial
expression recognition because of the high number of smiles, i.e. action unit
12. In detail, 30,792 have this action unit set, 82,176 images have some action unit(s) set and 48,612 images have no action unit(s) set at all. Fig. 1
contains a sample image of DISFA.

In the original paper on DISFA® multi-class SVMs were trained for the
different levels 0-5 of action unit intensity. Test accuracies for the individual
levels and for the binary action unit recognition problem are reported for
three different hand-crafted feature description techniques. In those three
cases, accuracies of 65.55%, 72.94% and 79.67% for smile recognition are
reported.

4. Smile recognition

In the following experiments, an aligned version of DISFA is used. In this
aligned version, the faces have been cropped and annotated with facial
landmark points. Facial landmark points allow to compute a bounding box
to fit the mouth in all images. In the experiments, two inputs are used: the
mouth and face, downscaled to 85 x 69 and 128 x 104 pixels, respectively.
Both inputs are used to assess if the mouth alone is as expressive as or even
more expressive than the entire face for smile recognition.

4.1. Model

The architecture of the network is as follows: The input images are fed into
a convolution comprising a convolutional and a subsampling layer. That
convolution may be followed by more convolutions to become gradually
July 26, 2017 1:47 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in paper

more invariant to distortions in the input. In the second stage, a regular
neural network follows the convolutions in order to discriminate the features
learned by the convolutions. The output layer consists of two units for
smile or no smile. The novelty of this approach is that the exact number
of convolutions, number of hidden layers and size of hidden layers are not
fixed but subject to extensive model selection in Sec. 4.3.

4.2. Experiment setting

Due to training time constraints, some parameters have been fixed to reasonable and empirical values, such as the size of convolutions (5 x 5 pixels,
32 feature maps) and the size of subsamplings (2 x 2 pixels using max
pooling). All layers use ReLU units, except of softmax being used in the
output layer. The learning rate is fixed to ~a = 0.01 and not subject to
model selection as it would significantly prolong the model selection. The
same considerations apply to the momentum, which is fixed to u = 0.9.

The entire database has been randomly split into a 60%/20%/20% training/validation/test ratio. Training neural networks comes with uncertainties, mostly due to the random initialization of the weights, but also due
to that random split of the data. Evaluations have shown that for 10 similar experiments carried out, the standard deviation of the test accuracy is
0.041725%. Because of this low standard deviation, performing each experiment exactly once has only a very low bias and is therefore relatively safe
to do for reasons of faster training time. Throughout the experiments, the
classification rate is used as the accuracy measure.

The model is implemented using Lasagne* and the generated CUDA
code is executed on a Tesla K40c® as training on a GPU allows to perform
a comprehensive model selection in a feasible amount of time. Stochastic
gradient descent with a batch size of 500 is used.

4.3. Parameter optimization

Table 1 contains the four parameters to be optimized: the number of convolutions, the number of hidden layers, the number of units per hidden layer
and the dropout factor. Each parameter was optimized independently due
to training time constraints. ‘This may not lead to an optimal model, but
has proven to work empirically well. Each model was trained for 50 epochs
in the model selection.

For both inputs, Table 2 contains the final models selected. For the
mouth input, there is a preference to more convolutions and more hidden

layers. ‘This is the case because slight translations or rotations in the mouth
input have stronger consequences on the classification result. In the entire
face, that sort of distortions may be less of a problem because other parts
of the face such as the cheeks contribute to smile recognition, too.

4.4. Results and discussion

Both final models were trained for 1000 epochs. The test accuracies of both
models started to converge after about 300 epochs. For the mouth and face
inputs, the best accuracies were achieved after 700 and 1000 epochs with
99.45% and 99.34%, respectively. Both models significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art SVM baselines reported in Sec. 3 ranging from 65.55% to
79.67%. Overall, there is no strong preference for either the mouth or face
input. Further experiments with a reduced dataset containing only 70%
of the images that have no action unit(s) set at all support this hypothesis. Concretely, the test accuracies for the mouth and face input reduced
to 99.24% and 99.26%, respectively. Thus, the difference between the two
models has been further reduced and this time giving a very low preference
for the face input. Nonetheless, this difference is not representative as it is
within the experiment error standard deviation reported in Sec. 4.2.
Training time per epoch are 82 seconds and 41 seconds for the mouth
and face input models, respectively. Experiments have shown that the training time mostly depends on the number of convolutions. Using the Tesla
K40c GPU has allowed to speed up the training time by factor ten over the
use of a CPU to execute the CPU code generated by the library. This clearly
July 26, 2017 1:47 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in paper

demonstrates the importance of training on a GPU to do a comprehensive
model selection in a feasible amount of time.

5. Conclusions and future work

Deep learning is an umbrella term for training neural networks with potentially many hidden layers using new training methods allowing to learn
complex feature hierarchies from data. Applied to action unit recognition
and smile recognition in particular, a deep convolutional neural network
model with an overall accuracy of 99.45% significantly outperforms existing approaches. The underlying extensive model selection allows to find for
each action unit an appropriate architecture in order to maximize test accuracies. In the future, we will extend the model to images from multiple
databases and to make predictions in image sequences.
