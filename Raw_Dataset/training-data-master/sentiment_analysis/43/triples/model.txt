(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||utilize||bidirectional coarsegrained attention)
(bidirectional coarsegrained attention||combine them with||finegrained attention vectors)
(finegrained attention vectors||to compose||multigrained attention network)
(multigrained attention network||for||final sentiment polarity prediction)
(Model||to make use of||valuable aspect - level interaction information)
(valuable aspect - level interaction information||design||aspect alignment loss)
(aspect alignment loss||to enhance||difference)
(difference||of||attention weights)
(difference||towards||aspects)
(aspects||which have||same context)
(aspects||which have||different sentiment polarities)
(aspect alignment loss||in||objective function)
(Model||propose||multi -grained attention network)
(Model||propose||fine - grained attention mechanism)
(fine - grained attention mechanism||to characterize||word - level interactions)
(word - level interactions||between||aspect and context words)
(fine - grained attention mechanism||relieve||information loss)
(information loss||occurred in||coarse - grained attention mechanism)
