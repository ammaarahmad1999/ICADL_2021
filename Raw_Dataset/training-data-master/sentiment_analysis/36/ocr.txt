Abstract

Target-oriented sentiment classification
aims at classifying sentiment polarities
over individual opinion targets in a sentence. RNN with attention seems a good
fit for the characteristics of this task, and
indeed it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. After re-examining the drawbacks of attention mechanism and the obstacles that block CNN to perform well in
this classification task, we propose a new
model to overcome these issues. Instead of
attention, our model employs a CNN layer
to extract salient features from the transformed word representations originated
from a bi-directional RNN layer. Between
the two layers, we propose a component
to generate target-specific representations
of words in the sentence, meanwhile incorporate a mechanism for preserving the
original contextual information from the
RNN layer. Experiments show that our
model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on a few benchmarks.!

1 Introduction

Target-oriented (also mentioned as “‘target-level”’
or “aspect-level” in some works) sentiment classification aims to determine sentiment polarities
over “opinion targets” that explicitly appear in the
sentences (Liu, 2012). For example, in the sentence “I am pleased with the fast log on, and the
long battery life”, the user mentions two targets
“The work was done when Xin Li was an intern at Tencent AI Lab. This project is substantially supported by a grant
from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, China (Project Code: 14203414).

github.com/lixin4ever/TNet

“log on” and “better life’, and expresses positive
sentiments over them. The task is usually formulated as predicting a sentiment category for a (target, sentence) pair.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanism, firstly proposed in machine
translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), is the most
commonly-used technique for this task. For example, Wang et al. (2016); Tang et al. (2016b);
Yang et al. (2017); Liu and Zhang (2017); Ma
et al. (2017) and Chen et al. (2017) employ attention to measure the semantic relatedness between
each context word and the target, and then use
the induced attention scores to aggregate contextual features for prediction. In these works, the
attention weight based combination of word-level
features for classification may introduce noise and
downgrade the prediction accuracy. For example,
in “This dish is my favorite and I always get it
and never get tired of it.”, these approaches tend
to involve irrelevant words such as “never” and
“tired” when they highlight the opinion modifier
‘favorite’. To some extent, this drawback is rooted
in the attention mechanism, as also observed in
machine translation (Luong et al., 2015) and image captioning (Xu et al., 2015).

Another observation is that the sentiment of a
target is usually determined by key phrases such
as “is my favorite”. By this token, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—whose capability for extracting the informative n-gram features
(also called “active local features”) as sentence
representations has been verified in (Kim, 2014;
Johnson and Zhang, 2015)— should be a suitable
model for this classification problem. However,
CNN likely fails in cases where a sentence expresses different sentiments over multiple targets,
such as “great food but the service was dreadful!”’.
One reason is that CNN cannot fully explore the
target information as done by RNN-based methods (Tang et al., 2016a).* Moreover, it is hard
for vanilla CNN to differentiate opinion words of
multiple targets. Precisely, multiple active local
features holding different sentiments (e.g., “great
food” and “service was dreadful”) may be captured for a single target, thus it will hinder the prediction.

We propose a new architecture, named TargetSpecific Transformation Networks (TNet), to
solve the above issues in the task of target sentiment classification. TNet firstly encodes the context information into word embeddings and generates the contextualized word representations with
LSTMs. To integrate the target information into
the word representations, TNet introduces a novel
Target-Specific Transformation (TST) component
for generating the target-specific word representations. Contrary to the previous attention-based approaches which apply the same target representation to determine the attention scores of individual
context words, TST firstly generates different representations of the target conditioned on individual
context words, then it consolidates each context
word with its tailor-made target representation to
obtain the transformed word representation. Considering the context word “/ong” and the target
“battery life’ in the above example, TST firstly
measures the associations between “long” and individual target words. Then it uses the association
scores to generate the target representation conditioned on “long”. After that, TST transforms
the representation of “long” into its target-specific
version with the new target representation. Note
that “long” could also indicate a negative sentiment (say for “startup time’’), and the above TST
is able to differentiate them.

As the context information carried by the representations from the LSTM layer will be lost
after the non-linear TST, we design a contextpreserving mechanism to contextualize the generated target-specific word representations. Such
mechanism also allows deep transformation structure to learn abstract features*. To help the CNN
feature extractor locate sentiment indicators more
accurately, we adopt a proximity strategy to scale
the input of convolutional layer with positional relevance between a word and the target.

"One method could be concatenating the target representation with each word representation, but the effect as shown
in (Wang et al., 2016) is limited.

* Abstract features usually refer to the features ultimately
useful for the task (Bengio et al., 2013; LeCun et al., 2015).

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

e TNet adapts CNN to handle target-level sentiment classification, and its performance dominates
the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets.

e A novel Target-Specific Transformation component is proposed to better integrate target information into the word representations.

e A context-preserving mechanism is designed
to forward the context information into a deep
transformation architecture, thus, the model can
learn more abstract contextualized word features
from deeper networks.

2 Model Description

Given a target-sentence pair (w’,w), where
w’ = {w7,w5,.--,wz,} is a sub-sequence of
w = {W1,W2,.--;Wn}, and the corresponding
word embeddings x7 = {xj,23,...,.77,} andx =
{21,22,..-,Xn}, the aim of target sentiment classification is to predict the sentiment polarity y €
{P,.N,O} of the sentence w over the target w’,
where P, N and O denote “positive”, “negative”
and “neutral” sentiments respectively.

The architecture of the proposed ‘TargetSpecific Transformation Networks (TNet) is
shown in Fig. 1. The bottom layer is a BiLSTM
which transforms the input x = {%1, %2,...,%n} €
R”’xdmw into the contextualized word representations h) = (7), nw), _ py & Rrx2aing
(i.e. hidden states of BiLSTM), where dim,,
and dim,;, denote the dimensions of the word embeddings and the hidden representations respectively. The middle part, the core part of our
TNet, consists of L Context-Preserving Transformation (CPT) layers. The CPT layer incorporates
the target information into the word representations via a novel Target-Specific Transformation
(TST) component. CPT also contains a contextpreserving mechanism, resembling identity mapping (He et al., 2016a,b) and highway connection (Srivastava et al., 2015a,b), allows preserving
the context information and learning more abstract
word-level features using a deep network. The top
most part is a position-aware convolutional layer
which first encodes positional relevance between
a word and a target, and then extracts informative
features for classification.

As observed in Lai et al. (2015), combining contextual information with word embeddings is an

effective way to represent a word in convolutionbased architectures. TNet also employs a BiLSTM to accumulate the context information for
each word of the input sentence, i.e., the bottom
part in Fig. 1. For simplicity and space issue, we
denote the operation of an LSTM unit on x; as
LSTM(z;). Thus, the contextualized word repre

pn = [LSTM(a;);LSTM(2;)],i € [1,n]. (1)

2.2 Context-Preserving Transformation

The above word-level representation has not considered the target information yet. Traditional
attention-based approaches keep the word-level
features static and aggregate them with weights
as the final sentence representation. In contrast,
as shown in the middle part in Fig. 1, we introduce multiple CPT layers and the detail of a single CPT is shown in Fig. 2. In each CPT layer,
a tailor-made TST component that aims at better
consolidating word representation and target representation is proposed. Moreover, we design a
context-preserving mechanism enabling the learning of target-specific word representations in a
deep neural architecture.

2.2.1 Target-Specific Transformation

TST component is depicted with the TST block in
Fig. 2. The first task of TST is to generate the representation of the target. Previous methods (Chen

et al., 2017; Liu and Zhang, 2017) average the embeddings of the target words as the target representation. This strategy may be inappropriate in
some cases because different target words usually
do not contribute equally. For example, in the target “amd turin processor’, the word “processor”
is more important than “amd” and “turin”, because
the sentiment is usually conveyed over the phrase
head, 1.e.,“processor’, but seldom over modifiers
(such as brand name “amd’’). Ma et al. (2017) attempted to overcome this issue by measuring the
importance score between each target word representation and the averaged sentence vector. However, it may be ineffective for sentences expressing
multiple sentiments (e.g., “Air has higher resolution but the fonts are small.”), because taking the
average tends to neutralize different sentiments.

We propose to dynamically compute the importance of target words based on each sentence word
rather than the whole sentence. We first employ
another BiLSTM to obtain the target word representations h™ € R™*24im ;

ht = ILSTM (27). L STM(27)],j € [l,m]. (2)

Then, we dynamically associate them with each
word w; in the sentence to tailor-make target representation r; at the time step 2:

ro = Sond F(a), Aa), (3)

j=1

where the function / measures the relatedness between the j-th target word representation h> and
the 2-th word-level representation ni:

where g(x) is a non-linear activation function and
‘*? denotes vector concatenation. W7 and b” are
the weights of the layer.

2.2.2 Context-Preserving Mechanism

After the non-linear TST (see Eq. 5), the context information captured with contextualized representations from the BiLSTM layer will be lost
since the mean and the variance of the features
within the feature vector will be changed. To take
advantage of the context information, which has
been proved to be useful in (Lai et al., 2015),
we investigate two strategies: Lossless Forwarding (LF) and Adaptive Scaling (AS), to pass the
context information to each following layer, as depicted by the block “LF/AS” in Fig. 2. Accordingly, the model variants are named TNet-LF and
TNet-AS.

Lossless Forwarding. ‘This strategy preserves
context information by directly feeding the features before the transformation to the next layer.
Specifically, the input pity of the (J + 1)-th CPT
layer is formulated as:

nee) = pO 4h ie [In], e [0,L], ©
where ni? is the input of the /-th layer and pi?

is the output of TST in this layer. We unfold the
recursive form of Eq. 6 as follows:

WY) = pO +rst (ni) +-.-4TST(A). (7)
Here, we denote ps? as TST (AY), From Eq. 7,
we can see that the output of each layer will contain the contextualized word representations (i.e.,
ny, thus, the context information is encoded
into the transformed features. We call this strategy “Lossless Forwarding” because the contextualized representations and the transformed representations (i.e., TST (hi?) are kept unchanged
during the feature combination.

Adaptive Scaling. Lossless Forwarding introduces the context information by directly adding
back the contextualized features to the transformed features, which raises a question: Can
the weights of the input and the transformed features be adjusted dynamically? With this motivation, we propose another strategy, named “‘Adaptive Scaling”. Similar to the gate mechanism in
RNN variants (Jozefowicz et al., 2015), Adaptive
Scaling introduces a gating function to control the
passed proportions of the transformed features and
the input features. The gate t as follows:

0 = o(Wiransh\” + birans), (8)

where t°” is the gate for the 7-th input of the /-th

tion. Then we perform convex combination of h;

and ji” based on the gate:
ne) = 9 DAO 4 -—M)on.  @)

Here, © denotes element-wise multiplication. The
non-recursive form of this equation is as follows
(for clarity, we ignore the subscripts):

l
A+) — (][a — t*))] © AO
k=0

l
+t [Ja -—t)] otsr(h®) +--k=1

+t—D (1 — 4) © tst(nl-Y) + 24 © tst(h©).

Thus, the context information is integrated in
each upper layer and the proportions of the contextualized representations and the transformed representations are controlled by the computed gates
in different transformation layers.

2.3 Convolutional Feature Extractor

Recall that the second issue that blocks CNN to
perform well is that vanilla CNN may associate a
target with unrelated general opinion words which
are frequently used as modifiers for different targets across domains. For example, “service” in
“Great food but the service is dreadful” may be
associated with both “great” and “dreadful”. To
solve it, we adopt a proximity strategy, which is
observed effective in (Chen et al., 2017; Li and
Lam, 2017). The idea is a closer opinion word is
more likely to be the actual modifier of the target.

Specifically, we first calculate the position relevance v; between the i-th word and the target*:

where k is the index of the first target word, C'is a

correct opinion w.r.t. the given target:

A =A) «v;,6€ [Lynj,le fl). dy
Based on Eq. 10 and Eq. 11, the words close to
the target will be highlighted and those far away
will be downgraded. v is also applied on the intermediate output to introduce the position information into each CPT layer. Then we feed the
weighted h) to the convolutional layer, i.e., the

Finally, we pass z to a fully connected layer for

sentiment prediction:

where W; and bf are learnable parameters.

*As we perform sentence padding, it is possible that the

3 Experiments

3.1 Experimental Setup

As shown in Table 1, we evaluate the proposed
TNet on three benchmark datasets: LAPTOP and
REST are from SemEval ABSA challenge (Pontiki et al., 2014), containing user reviews in laptop
domain and restaurant domain respectively. We
also remove a few examples having the “conflict
label” as done in (Chen et al., 2017); TWITTER
is built by Dong et al. (2014), containing twitter
posts. All tokens are lowercased without removal
of stop words, symbols or digits, and sentences are
zero-padded to the length of the longest sentence
in the dataset. Evaluation metrics are Accuracy
and Macro-Averaged F1 where the latter is more
appropriate for datasets with unbalanced classes.
We also conduct pairwise t-test on both Accuracy
and Macro-Averaged F1 to verify if the improvements over the compared models are reliable.
TNet is compared with the following methods.

e SVM (Kiritchenko et al., 2014): It is a traditional support vector machine based model
with extensive feature engineering;

e AdaRNN (Dong et al., 2014): It learns the
sentence representation toward target for sentiment prediction via semantic composition
over dependency tree;

e AE-LSTM, and ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al.,
2016): AE-LSTM is a simple LSTM model
incorporating the target embedding as input,
while ATAE-LSTM extends AE-LSTM with
attention;

e IAN (Ma et al., 2017): IAN employs two
LSTMs to learn the representations of the
context and the target phrase interactively;

e CNN-ASP: It is a CNN-based model implemented by us which directly concatenates target representation to each word embedding;

e TD-LSTM (Tang et al., 2016a): It employs
two LSTMs to model the left and right contexts of the target separately, then performs
predictions based on concatenated context
representations;

e MemNet (Tang et al., 2016b): It applies
attention mechanism over the word embeddings multiple times and predicts sentiments

We run the released codes of TD-LSTM and
BILSTM-ATT-G to generate results, since their
papers only reported results on TWITTER. We
also rerun MemNet on our datasets and evaluate
it with both accuracy and Macro-Averaged F1.°

We use pre-trained GloVe vectors (Pennington
et al., 2014) to initialize the word embeddings
and the dimension is 300 (i.e., dim,, = 300).
For out-of-vocabulary words, we randomly sample their embeddings from the uniform distribution U(—0.25, 0.25), as done in (Kim, 2014). We
only use one convolutional kernel size because it
was observed that CNN with single optimal kernel size is comparable with CNN having multiple
kernel sizes on small datasets (Zhang and Wallace,
2017). To alleviate overfitting, we apply dropout
on the input word embeddings of the LSTM and
the ultimate sentence representation z. All weight
matrices are initialized with the uniform distribution 2/(—0.01, 0.01) and the biases are initialized

and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) is adopted as
the optimizer by following the learning rate and
the decay rates in the original paper.

The hyper-parameters of TNet-LF and TNetAS are listed in Table 2. Specifically, all hyperparameters are tuned on 20% randomly held-out
training data and the hyper-parameter collection
producing the highest accuracy score is used for
testing. Our model has comparable number of
parameters compared to traditional LSTM-based
models as we reuse parameters in the transformation layers and BiLSTM.®

3.2 Main Results

As shown in Table 3, both TNet-LF and TNet-AS
consistently achieve the best performance on all
datasets, which verifies the efficacy of our whole
TNet model. Moreover, TNet can perform well for
different kinds of user generated content, such as
product reviews with relatively formal sentences
in LAPTOP and REST, and tweets with more ungrammatical sentences in TWITTER. The reason
is the CNN-based feature extractor arms TNet
with more power to extract accurate features from
ungrammatical sentences. Indeed, we can also observe that another CNN-based baseline, 1.e., CNNASP implemented by us, also obtains good results
on TWITTER.

On the other hand, the performance of those
comparison methods is mostly unstable. For the
tweet in TWITTER, the competitive BILSTMATT-G and RAM cannot perform as effective as
they do for the reviews in LAPTOP and REST, due
to the fact that they are heavily rooted in LSTMs
and the ungrammatical sentences hinder their ca

1080. The prediction cost of a sentence is about 2 ms.

pability in capturing the context features. Another
difficulty caused by the ungrammatical sentences
is that the dependency parsing might be errorprone, which will affect those methods such as
AdaRNN using dependency information.

From the above observations and analysis, some
takeaway message for the task of target sentiment
classification could be:

e LSTM-based models relying on sequential
information can perform well for formal sentences by capturing more useful context features;

e For ungrammatical text, CNN-based models may have some advantages because CNN
aims to extract the most informative n-gram
features and is thus less sensitive to informal
texts without strong sequential patterns.

3.3. Performance of Ablated TNet

To investigate the impact of each component such
as deep transformation, context-preserving mechanism, and positional relevance, we perform comparison between the full TNet models and its ablations (the third group in Table 3). After removing
the deep transformation (i.e., the techniques introduced in Section 2.2), both TNet-LF and TNetAS are reduced to TNet w/o transformation (where

position relevance is kept), and their results in both
accuracy and Fl measure are incomparable with
those of TNet. It shows that the integration of target information into the word-level representations
is crucial for good performance.

Comparing the results of TNet and TNet w/o
context (where TST and position relevance are
kept), we observe that the performance of TNet
w/o context drops significantly on LAPTOP and
REST’, while on TWITTER, TNet w/o context
performs very competitive (p-values with TNetLF and TNet-AS are 0.066 and 0.053 respectively for Accuracy). Again, we could attribute
this phenomenon to the ungrammatical user generated content of twitter, because the contextpreserving component becomes less important for
such data. TNet w/o context performs consistently
better than TNet w/o transformation, which verifies the efficacy of the target specific transformation (TST), before applying context-preserving.

As for the position information, we conduct
statistical t-test between TNet-LF/AS and TNetLF/AS w/o position together with performance
comparison. All of the produced p-values are
less than 0.05, suggesting that the improvements
brought in by position information are significant.

TWithout specification, the significance level is set to 0.05.
3.4 CPT versus Alternatives

The next interesting question is what if we replace
the transformation module (i.e., the CPT layers in
Fig.1) of TNet with other commonly-used components? We investigate two alternatives: attention
mechanism and fully-connected (FC) layer, resulting in three pipelines as shown in the second group
of Table 3 (position relevance is kept for them).

LSTM-ATT-CNN applies attention as the alternative®, and it does not need the contextpreserving mechanism. It performs unexceptionally worse than the TNet variants. We are surprised that LSTM-ATT-CNN is even worse than
TNet w/o transformation (a pipeline simply removing the transformation module) on TWITTER.
More concretely, applying attention results in negative effect on TWITTER, which is consistent
with the observation that all those attention-based
state-of-the-art methods (i.e., TD-LSTM, MemNet, BILSTM-ATT-G, and RAM) cannot perform
well on TWITTER.

LSTM-FC-CNN-LF and LSTM-FC-CNN-AS
are built by applying FC layer to replace TST
and keeping the context-preserving mechanism
(i.e., LF and AS). Specifically, the concatenation of word representation and the averaged target vector is fed to the FC layer to obtain targetspecific features. Note that LSTM-FC-CNNLF/AS are equivalent to TNet-LF/AS when processing single-word targets (see Eq. 3). They obtain competitive results on all datasets: comparable with or better than the state-of-the-art methods.
The TNet variants can still outperform LSTMFC-CNN-LF/AS with significant gaps, e.g., on
LAPTOP and REST, the accuracy gaps between
TNet-LF and LSTM-FC-CNN-LE are 0.42% (p <
0.03) and 0.38% (p < 0.04) respectively.

3.5 Impact of CPT Layer Number

As our TNet involves multiple CPT layers, we investigate the effect of the layer number L. Specifically, we conduct experiments on the held-out
training data of LAPTOP and vary L from 2 to
10, increased by 2. The cases L=1 and L=15 are
also included. The results are illustrated in Figure 3. We can see that both TNet-LF and TNetAS achieve the best results when L=2. While increasing L, the performance is basically becoming
worse. For large L, the performance of TNet-AS

best one here, namely, dot attention (Luong et al., 2015).

generally becomes more sensitive, it is probably
because AS involves extra parameters (see Eq 9)
that increase the training difficulty.

3.6 Case Study

Table 4 shows some sample cases. The input targets are wrapped in the brackets with true labels
given as subscripts. The notations P, N and O
in the table represent positive, negative and neutral respectively. For each sentence, we underline the target with a particular color, and the
text of its corresponding most informative n-gram
feature’ captured by TNet-AS (TNet-LF captures
very similar features) is in the same color (so color
printing is preferred). For example, for the target
“resolution” in the first sentence, the captured feature is “Air has higher’. Note that as discussed
above, the CNN layer of TNet captures such features with the size-three kernels, so that the features are trigrams. Each of the last features of the
second and seventh sentences contains a padding
token, which is not shown.

Our TNet variants can predict target sentiment
more accurately than RAM and BILSTM-ATT-G
in the transitional sentences such as the first sentence by capturing correct trigram features. For
the third sentence, its second and third most informative trigrams are “100% . PAD” and “’ s not”,
being used together with “features make up’, our
models can make correct predictions. Moreover,
TNet can still make correct prediction when the
explicit opinion is target-specific. For example,

For each convolutional filter, only one n-gram feature in
the feature map will be kept after the max pooling. Among
those from different filters, the n-gram with the highest fre
quency will be regarded as the most informative n-gram w.r.t.
the given target.

Table 4: Example predictions, color printing is preferred. The input targets are wrapped in brackets with

“long” in the fifth sentence is negative for “startup
time”, while it could be positive for other targets
such as “battery life” in the sixth sentence. The
sentiment of target-specific opinion word is conditioned on the given target. Our TNet variants,
armed with the word-level feature transformation
w.r.t. the target, is capable of handling such case.
We also find that all these models cannot give
correct prediction for the last sentence, a commonly used subjunctive style. In this case, the difficulty of prediction does not come from the detection of explicit opinion words but the inference
based on implicit semantics, which is still quite
challenging for neural network models.

4 Related Work

Apart from sentence level sentiment classification (Kim, 2014; Shi et al., 2018), aspect/target
level sentiment classification is also an important research topic in the field of sentiment analysis. The early methods mostly adopted supervised
learning approach with extensive hand-coded features (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Titov and
McDonald, 2008; Yu et al., 2011; Jiang et al.,
2011; Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Wagner et al.,
2014; Vo and Zhang, 2015), and they fail to model
the semantic relatedness between a target and its
context which is critical for target sentiment analysis. Dong et al. (2014) incorporate the target information into the feature learning using dependency trees. As observed in previous works, the
performance heavily relies on the quality of dependency parsing. Tang et al. (2016a) propose to
split the context into two parts and associate target with contextual features separately. Similar to
(Tang et al., 2016a), Zhang et al. (2016) develop a
three-way gated neural network to model the in
teraction between the target and its surrounding
contexts. Despite the advantages of jointly modeling target and context, they are not capable of
capturing long-range information when some critical context information is far from the target. To
overcome this limitation, researchers bring in the
attention mechanism to model target-context association (Tang et al., 2016a,b; Wang et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2017; Liu and Zhang, 2017; Ma et al.,
2017; Chen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Tay
et al., 2017). Compared with these methods, our
TNet avoids using attention for feature extraction
so as to alleviate the attended noise.

5 Conclusions

We re-examine the drawbacks of attention mechanism for target sentiment classification, and also
investigate the obstacles that hinder CNN-based
models to perform well for this task. Our TNet
model is carefully designed to solve these issues.
Specifically, we propose target specific transformation component to better integrate target information into the word representation. Moreover,
we employ CNN as the feature extractor for this
classification problem, and rely on the contextpreserving and position relevance mechanisms to
maintain the advantages of previous LSTM-based
models. The performance of TNet consistently
dominates previous state-of-the-art methods on
different types of data. The ablation studies show
the efficacy of its different modules, and thus verify the rationality of TNet’s architecture.
