Abstract

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA),
which aims to identify fine-grained opinion
polarity towards a specific aspect, is a challenging subtask of sentiment analysis (SA).
In this paper, we construct an auxiliary sentence from the aspect and convert ABSA to a
sentence-pair classification task, such as question answering (QA) and natural language inference (NLI). We fine-tune the pre-trained
model from BERT and achieve new state-ofthe-art results on SentiHood and SemEval2014 Task 4 datasets.!

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important task in
natural language processing. It solves the computational processing of opinions, emotions, and
subjectivity - sentiment is collected, analyzed and
summarized. It has received much attention not
only in academia but also in industry, providing real-time feedback through online reviews on
websites such as Amazon, which can take advantage of customers’ opinions on specific products or
services. The underlying assumption of this task is
that the entire text has an overall polarity.

However, the users’ comments may contain different aspects, such as: “This book is a hardcover
version, but the price is a bit high.” The polarity in
‘appearance’ is positive, and the polarity regarding
‘price’ is negative. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) (Jo and Oh, 2011; Pontiki et al., 2014,
2015, 2016) aims to identify fine-grained polarity
towards a specific aspect. This task allows users to
evaluate aggregated sentiments for each aspect of
a given product or service and gain a more granular understanding of their quality.

Both SA and ABSA are sentence-level or
document-level tasks, but one comment may refer to more than one object, and sentence-level
tasks cannot handle sentences with multiple targets. Therefore, Saeidi et al. (2016) introduce
the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA), which aims to identify fine-grained
opinion polarity towards a specific aspect associated with a given target. The task can be divided
into two steps: (1) the first step is to determine the
aspects associated with each target; (2) the second
step is to resolve the polarity of aspects to a given
target.

The earliest work on (T)ABSA relied heavily on feature engineering (Wagner et al., 2014;
Kiritchenko et al., 2014), and subsequent neural network-based methods (Nguyen and Shirai,
2015; Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2015, 2016;
Wang et al., 2017) achieved higher accuracy. Recently, Ma et al. (2018) incorporate useful commonsense knowledge into a deep neural network to further enhance the result of the model.
Liu et al. (2018) optimize the memory network
and apply it to their model to better capture linguistic structure.

More recently, the pre-trained language models,
such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT
(Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018), have shown their effectiveness to alleviate the effort of feature engineering. Especially,
BERT has achieved excellent results in QA and
NLI. However, there is not much improvement
in (T)ABSA task with the direct use of the pretrained BERT model (see Table 3). We think this
is due to the inappropriate use of the pre-trained
BERT model.

Since the input representation of BERT can represent both a single text sentence and a pair of
text sentences, we can convert (T)ABSA into a
sentence-pair classification task and fine-tune the
pre-trained BERT.

In this paper, we investigate several methods
of constructing an auxiliary sentence and transform (T)ABSA into a sentence-pair classification
task. We fine-tune the pre-trained model from
BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on
(T)ABSA task. We also conduct a comparative experiment to verify that the classification based on
a sentence-pair is better than the single-sentence
classification with fine-tuned BERT, which means
that the improvement is not only from BERT but
also from our method. In particular, our contribution is two-fold:

1. We propose a new solution of (T)ABSA by
converting it to a sentence-pair classification task.

2. We fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model
and achieve new state-of-the-art results on SentiHood and SemEval-2014 Task 4 datasets.

2 Methodology
In this section, we describe our method in detail.

2.1 Task description
TABSA_ In TABSA, a sentence s usually con
sists of a series of words: {wyj,--- ,wWm)},
and some of the words {wj,,--:,w;,} are
pre-identified targets {t,,---,t,}, following

Saeidi et al. (2016), we set the task as a 3class classification problem: given the sentence s, a set of target entities 7’ and a
fixed aspect set A = {general, price, transitlocation, safety}, predict the sentiment polarity
y © {positive, negative, none} over the full set
of the target-aspect pairs {(t,a) :t € T,a € A}.
As we can see in Table 1, the gold standard polarity of (LOCATION2, price) is negative, while the
polarity of (LOCATION I], price) is none.

ABSA In ABSA, the target-aspect pairs {t, a}
become only aspects a. This setting is equivalent to learning subtasks 3 (Aspect Category Detection) and subtask 4 (Aspect Category Polarity)
of SemEval-2014 Task 4? at the same time.

2.2 Construction of the auxiliary sentence

For simplicity, we mainly describe our method
with TABSA as an example.

We consider the following four methods to convert the TABSA task into a sentence pair classification task:

*http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/

Example:
LOCATION2 is central London so extremely expensive, LOCATIONI is often considered the

coolest area of London.

Target Aspect Sentiment
LOC1 general Positive
LOCI price None
LOC1 safety None
LOCI transit-location None
LOC2 general None
LOC2 price Negative
LOC2 safety None
LOC2 transit-location Positive

Table 1: An example of SentiHood dataset.

Methods Output Auxiliary Sentence
QA-M S.P. Question w/o S.P.
NLI-M S.P. Pseudo-sentence w/o S.P.
QA-B ____{yes,no} Question w/ S.P.
NLI-B — {yes,no} _Pseudo-sentence w/ S.P.

Table 2: The construction methods. Due to limited
space, we use the following abbreviations: S.P. for sentiment polarity, w/o for without, and w/ for with.

Sentences for QA-M_ The sentence we want to
generate from the target-aspect pair is a question,
and the format needs to be the same. For example,
for the set of a target-aspect pair (LOCATION 1,
safety), the sentence we generate is “what do you
think of the safety of location - 1 ?”

Sentences for NLI-M_ For the NLI task, the conditions we set when generating sentences are less
strict, and the form is much simpler. The sentence created at this time is not a standard sentence, but a simple pseudo-sentence, with (LOCATION], safety) pair as an example: the auxiliary
sentence is: “location - | - safety”.

Sentences for QA-B For QA-B, we add the label information and temporarily convert TABSA
into a binary classification problem (label €
{yes,no}) to obtain the probability distribution.
At this time, each target-aspect pair will generate three sequences such as “the polarity of the
aspect safety of location - | is positive’, “the
polarity of the aspect safety of location - | is
negative”, “the polarity of the aspect safety of
location - 1 is none”. We use the probability value of yes as the matching score. For a
target-aspect pair which generates three sequences
(positive, negative, none), we take the class of
the sequence with the highest matching score for
the predicted category.

Sentences for NLI-B The difference between
NLI-B and QA-B is that the auxiliary sentence
changes from a question to a pseudo-sentence.
The auxiliary sentences are: “location - | - safety
- positive’, “location - | - safety - negative’, and
“location - | - safety - none”.

After we construct the auxiliary sentence, we
can transform the TABSA task from a single sentence classification task to a sentence pair classification task. As shown in Table 3, this is a necessary operation that can significantly improve the
experimental results of the TABSA task.

2.3 Fine-tuning pre-trained BERT

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a new language representation model, which uses bidirectional transformers to pre-train a large corpus, and fine-tunes
the pre-trained model on other tasks. We finetune the pre-trained BERT model on TABSA task.
Let’s take a brief look at the input representation
and the fine-tuning procedure.

2.3.1 Input representation

The input representation of the BERT can explicitly represent a pair of text sentences in a sequence
of tokens. For a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings. For
classification tasks, the first word of each sequence
is a unique classification embedding ([CLS]).

2.3.2 Fine-tuning procedure

BERT fine-tuning is straightforward. To obtain a
fixed-dimensional pooled representation of the input sequence, we use the final hidden state (i.e.,
the output of the transformer) of the first token
as the input. We denote the vector as C € R”.
Then we add a classification layer whose parameter matrix is W ¢ R**#, where K is the number of categories. Finally, the probability of each
category P is calculated by the softmax function
P = softmax(CW’7°).

2.3.3. BERT-single and BERT-pair

BERT-single for (T)ABSA BERT for single
sentence classification tasks. Suppose the number
of target categories are mn; and aspect categories

are N_. We consider TABSA as a combination
of nz - Ng target-aspect-related sentiment classification problems, first classifying each sentiment
classification problem, and then summarizing the
results obtained. For ABSA, We fine-tune pretrained BERT model to train n, classifiers for all
aspects and then summarize the results.

BERT-pair for (T)ABSA BERT for sentence
pair classification tasks. Based on the auxillary sentence constructed in Section 2.2, we use
the sentence-pair classification approach to solve
(T)ABSA. Corresponding to the four ways of constructing sentences, we name the models: BERTpair-QA-M, BERT-pair-NLI-M, BERT-pair-QAB, and BERT-pair-NLI-B.

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets

We evaluate our method on the SentiHood
(Saeidi et al., 2016) dataset*, which consists of
5,215 sentences, 3,862 of which contain a single
target, and the remainder multiple targets. Each
sentence contains a list of target-aspect pairs {t, a}
with the sentiment polarity y. Ultimately, given a
sentence s and the target ¢ in the sentence, we need
to:

(1) detect the mention of an aspect a for the target f;

(2) determine the positive or negative sentiment
polarity y for detected target-aspect pairs.

We also evaluate our method on SemEval-2014
Task 4 (Pontiki et al., 2014) dataset* for aspectbased sentiment analysis. The only difference
from the SentiHood is that the target-aspect pairs
{t,a} become only aspects a. This setting allows
us to jointly evaluate subtask 3 (Aspect Category
Detection) and subtask 4 (Aspect Category Polar
ity).
3.2 Hyperparameters

We use the pre-trained uncased BERT-base
model? for fine-tuning. The number of Transformer blocks is 12, the hidden layer size is
768, the number of self-attention heads is 12,
and the total number of parameters for the pretrained model is 110M. When fine-tuning, we keep

the dropout probability at 0.1, set the number of
epochs to 4. The initial learning rate is 2e-5, and
the batch size is 24.

3.3. Exp-I: TABSA

We compare our model with the following models:

e LR (Saeidi et al., 2016): a logistic regression
classifier with n-gram and pos-tag features.

e LSTM-Final (Saeidi et al., 2016): a biLSTM
model with the final state as a representation.

e LSTM-Loc (Saeidi et al., 2016): a biLSTM
model with the state associated with the target position as a representation.

e LSTM+TA+SA (Ma et al., 2018): a biLSTM
model which introduces complex target-level
and sentence-level attention mechanisms.

e SenticLSTM (Ma et al., 2018): an upgraded
version of the LSTM+TA+SA model which
introduces external information from SenticNet (Cambria et al., 2016).

e Dmu-Entnet (Liuvetal., 2018): a bidirectional EntNet (Henaff et al., 2016) with
external “memory chains” with a delayed
memory update mechanism to track entities.

During the evaluation of SentiHood, following
Saeidi et al. (2016), we only consider the four
most frequently seen aspects (general, price,
transit-location, safety). When evaluating the aspect detection, following Ma et al. (2018), we use

strict accuracy and Macro-F1, and we also report
AUC. In sentiment classification, we use accuracy
and macro-average AUC as the evaluation indices.

3.3.1 Results

Results on SentiHood are presented in Table 3.
The results of the BERT-single model on aspect
detection are better than Dmu-Entnet, but the accuracy of sentiment classification is much lower
than that of both SenticLstm and Dmu-Entnet,
with a difference of 3.8 and 5.5 respectively.

However, BERT-pair outperforms other models
on aspect detection and sentiment analysis by a
substantial margin, obtaining 9.4 macro-average
Fl and 2.6 accuracies improvement over DmuEntnet. Overall, the performance of the four
BERT-pair models is close. It is worth noting that
BERT-pair-NLI models perform relatively better
on aspect detection, while BERT-pair-QA models
perform better on sentiment classification. Also,
the BERT-pair-QA-B and BERT-pair-NLI-B models can achieve better AUC values on sentiment
classification than the other models.

3.4 Exp-II: ABSA

The benchmarks for SemEval-2014 Task 4 are
the two best performing systems in Pontiki et al.
(2014) and ATAE-LSTM (Wang etal., 2016).
When evaluating SemEval-2014 Task 4 subtask 3
and subtask 4, following Pontiki et al. (2014), we
use Micro-F1 and accuracy respectively.

3.4.1 Results

Results on SemEval-2014 are presented in Table 4 and Table 5. We find that BERT-single
has achieved better results on these two subtasks,
and BERT-pair has achieved further improvements
over BERT-single. The BERT-pair-NLI-B model
achieves the best performance for aspect category
detection. For aspect category polarity, BERTpair-QA-B performs best on all 4-way, 3-way, and
binary settings.

4 Discussion

Why is the experimental result of the BERT-pair
model so much better? On the one hand, we
convert the target and aspect information into an
auxiliary sentence, which is equivalent to exponentially expanding the corpus. A sentence s;
in the original data set will be expanded into

(s;,t1,€@1),°°° , (Si, t1, Ang), °° , (Si, trp; Ang) in

the sentence pair classification task. On the other
hand, it can be seen from the amazing improvement of the BERT model on the QA and NLI tasks
(Devlin et al., 2018) that the BERT model has an
advantage in dealing with sentence pair classification tasks. This advantage comes from both unsupervised masked language model and next sentence prediction tasks.

TABSA is more complicated than SA due to additional target and aspect information. Directly
fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT on TABSA does
not achieve performance growth. However, when
we separate the target and the aspect to form an
auxiliary sentence and transform the TABSA into
a sentence pair classification task, the scenario is
similar to QA and NLI, and then the advantage of
the pre-trained BERT model can be fully utilized.
Our approach is not limited to TABSA, and this
construction method can be used for other similar
tasks. For ABSA, we can use the same approach to
construct the auxiliary sentence with only aspects.

In BERT-pair models, BERT-pair-QA-B and
BERT-pair-NLI-B achieve better AUC values on
sentiment classification, probably because of the
modeling of label information.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we constructed an auxiliary sentence to transform (T)ABSA from a single sentence classification task to a sentence pair classification task. We fine-tuned the pre-trained
BERT model on the sentence pair classification
task and obtained the new state-of-the-art results.
We compared the experimental results of single
sentence classification and sentence pair classification based on BERT fine-tuning, analyzed the
advantages of sentence pair classification, and verified the validity of our conversion method. In the
future, we will apply this conversion method to
other similar tasks.
