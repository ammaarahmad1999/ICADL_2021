ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

Keywords: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task is a multi-grained task of natural language proaspect term extraction cessing and consists of two subtasks: aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classifiaspect polarity classification cation (APC). Most of the existing work focuses on the subtask of aspect term polarity inferring
Chinese sentiment analysis and ignores the significance of aspect term extraction. Besides, the existing researches do not
multi-task learning pay attention to the research of the Chinese-oriented ABSA task. Based on the local context
multilingual ABSA focus (LCF) mechanism, this paper firstly proposes a multi-task learning model for Chinesedomain-adaption BERT oriented aspect-based sentiment analysis, namely LCF-ATEPC. Compared with existing mod
els, this model equips the capability of extracting aspect term and inferring aspect term polarity
synchronously, moreover, this model is effective to analyze both Chinese and English comments
simultaneously and the experiment on a multilingual mixed dataset proved its availability. By
integrating the domain-adapted BERT model, the LCF-ATEPC model achieved the state-ofthe-art performance of aspect term extraction and aspect polarity classification in four Chinese
review datasets. Besides, the experimental results on the most commonly used SemEval-2014
task4 Restaurant and Laptop datasets outperform the state-of-the-art performance on the ATE
subtask.

1. Introduction

Aspect-based sentiment analysis Pontiki, Galanis, Pavlopoulos, Papageorgiou, Androutsopoulos and Manandhar (2014); Pontiki, Galanis, Papageorgiou, Manandhar and Androutsopoulos (2015); Pontiki, Galanis, Papageorgiou, Androutsopoulos, Manandhar, AL-Smadi, Al-Ayyoub, Zhao, Qin, De Clercq, Hoste, Apidianaki, Tannier,
Loukachevitch, Kotelnikov, Bel, Jiménez-Zafra and Eryigit (2016) (ABSA) is a fine-grained task compared with
traditional sentiment analysis, which requires the model to be able to automatic extract the aspects and predict the
polarities of all the aspects. For example, given a restaurant review: "The dessert at this restaurant is delicious but the
service is poor," the full-designed model for ABSA needs to extract the aspects "dessert" and "service" and correctly
reason about their polarity. In this review, the consumers’ opinions on "dessert" and "service" are not consistent, with
positive and negative sentiment polarity respectively.

Generally, aspects and their polarity need to be manually labeled before running the aspect polarity classification
procedure in the supervised deep learning models. However, most of the proposed models for aspect-based sentiment
analysis tasks only focus on improving the classification accuracy of aspect polarity and ignore the research of aspect
term extraction. Therefore, when conducting transfer learning on aspect-based sentiment analysis, those proposed
models often fall into the dilemma of lacking aspect extraction method on targeted tasks because there is not enough
research support.

The APC task is a kind of classification problem. The researches concerning APC tasks is more abundant than the
ATE task, and a large number of deep learning-based models have been proposed to solve APC problems, such as the
models Vo and Zhang (2015); Wagner, Arora, Cortes, Barman, Bogdanova, Foster and Tounsi (2014); Tang, Qin, Feng
and Liu (2016); Wang, Huang, Zhu and Zhao (2016); Ma, Li, Zhang and Wang (2017); Fan, Feng and Zhao (2018)

based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and the methodologies Song, Wang, Jiang, Liu and Rao (2019); Zeng,
Yang, Xu, Zhou and Han (2019a) based on transformer Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit, Jones, Gomez, Kaiser
and Polosukhin (2017). The purpose of the APC task is to predict the exact sentiment polarity of different aspects
in their context, rather than to fuzzily analyze the overall sentiment polarity on the sentence-level or document-level.
In the APC task, the polarities are most usually classified into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. It is
obvious that the sentiment polarity classified based on aspects can better mine the fine-grained emotional tendency in
reviews or tweets, thus providing a more accurate reference for decision-makers.

Similar to the named entity recognition Sang and De Meulder (2003) (NER) task, the ATE task is a sequence
labeling task, which aims to extract aspects from the reviews or tweet. In most researches Chen, Sun, Bing and Yang
(2017a); Xue and Li (2018); Chen, Xu, He and Wang (2017b), the ATE task is studied independently, away from the
APC task. The ATE task first segments a review into separate tokens and then infers whether the tokens belong to
any aspect. The tokens may be labeled in different forms in different studies, but most of the studies have adopted the
IOB? label to annotate tokens.

Aiming to automatically extract aspects from the text efficiently and analyze the sentiment polarity of aspects
simultaneously, this paper proposes a multi-task learning model for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Multilingual
processing is an important research orientation of natural language processing. The LCF-ATEPC?’ model proposed in
this paper is a novel multilingual and multi-task-oriented model. Apart from achieving state-of-the-art performance in
commonly used SemEval-2014 task4 datasets, the experimental results in four Chinese review datasets also validate
that this model has a strong ability to expand and adapt to the needs of multilingual task. The proposed model is
based on multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and integrates the pre-trained BERT Devlin, Chang, Lee and Toutanova
(2019) and the local context focus mechanism, namely LCF-ATEPC. By training on a small amount of annotated data
of aspect and their polarity, the model can be adapted to a large-scale dataset, automatically extracting the aspects
and predicting the sentiment polarities. In this way, the model can discover the unknown aspects and avoids the
tedious and huge cost of manually annotating all aspects and polarities. It is of great significance for the field-specific
aspect-based sentiment analysis.

The main contributions of this article are as follows:

1. For the first time, this paper studies the multi-task model of APC subtask and ATE subtask for multilingual
reviews, which provides a new idea for the research of Chinese aspect extraction.

2. This paper firstly applies self-attention and local context focus techniques to aspect word extraction task, and
fully explore their potential in aspect term extraction task.

3. The LCF-ATEPC model proposed in this paper integrates the pre-trained BERT model, significantly improves
both the performance of ATE task and APC subtask, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance especially
the Fl score of ATE task. Besides, we adopted the domain-adapted BERT model trained on the domain-related

corpus to the ABSA joint-task learning model. The experimental results show that the domain-adapted BERT
model significantly promotes the performance of APC tasks on the three datasets, especially the Restaurant
dataset.

4. We designed and applied dual labels for the input sequence applicable for the SemEval-2014 and Chinese review
datasets of ABSA joint-task, the aspect term label, and the sentiment polarity label, respectively. The dual label
improves the learning efficiency of the proposed model.

2. Related Works

Most ABSA-oriented methodologies regard the ATE and the APC as independent tasks and major in one of them.
Accordingly, this section will introduce the related works of ATE and APC in two parts.

2.1. Aspect Term Extraction

The approaches to ATE tasks are classified into two categories: the early dictionary-based or rule-based approaches, and methodologies based on machine-learning or deep learning. Poria, Cambria, Ku, Gui and Gelbukh
(2014) proposed a new rule-based approach to extracting aspects from product reviews using common sense and
sentence dependency trees to detect explicit and implicit aspects. Liu, Gao, Liu and Zhang (2015) adopts an unsupervised and domain-independent aspect extraction method that relies on syntactic dependency rules and can selects
rules automatically.

Compared with manually annotating all aspects in the dataset, the models for ATE can learn the features of aspects
and automatically extract aspects in the text, which greatly saves labor and time. Mukherjee and Liu (2012) proposed
a model that can extract and cluster aspects simultaneously according to the seed words provided by users for several
aspect categories. By classification, synonymous aspects can be grouped into the same category. Poria, Cambria
and Gelbukh (2016) proposed the first aspect-oriented deep learning model in opinion mining, which deploys a 7layer deep convolutional neural network to mark each word in the sentences with opinions as an aspect or non-aspect
word. He, Lee, Ng and Dahlmeier (2017) proposed a new method for aspect term extraction, which utilizes word
embedding to explore the co-occurrence distribution of words and applies the attention mechanism to weaken the
irrelevant words and further improves the coherence of all aspects. Wang, Pan, Dahlmeier and Xiao (2017) proposed
a deep neural network-based model namely coupled multilevel attention, which does not require any parser or other
linguistic resources to be pre-processed and provides an end-to-end solution. Besides, the proposed model is a multilayer attention network, where each layer deploys a pair of attentions. This model allows the aspect terms and opinion
terms learned interactively and dual propagate during the training process.

For the Chinese-oriented ATE task, a multi-aspect bootstrapping (MAB) method Zhu, Wang, Zhu, Tsou and Ma
(2011) is proposed to extract the aspects of Chinese restaurant reviews. Zhao, Dong and Yang (2015a) introduced
machine learning methods to explore and extract aspect terms from Chinese hotel reviews. they chose the optimal
feature-dimension, feature representation, and maximum entropy (ME) classifier according to the empirical results,
and studied the integral effect of aspect extraction.

Up to now, the MHSA and pre-trained model has not been applied in the ATE task. This paper explores the
potential of the new techniques of deep learning and new network architecture in the ATE task.

2.2. Aspect Polarity Classification

Aspect polarity classification is another important subtask of ABSA. The approaches designed for the APC task
can be categorized into traditional machine learning and recent deep learning methods.The APC task has been comprehensively turned to the the deep neural networks. Therefore, this section mainly introduces approaches based on
deep learning techniques.

The most commonly applied deep neural network architectures for APC task are recurrent neural networks Tang
et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2016); Ma et al. (2017); Li, Bing, Lam and Shi (2018); Huang, Ou and Carley (2018)
(RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) Xue and Li (2018); Chen et al. (2017b); Zhang, Zou and Gan
(2018). TD-LSTM Tang et al. (2016) first divides the context of aspects into the left and right parts and modeling
for them independently. Attention mechanism Bahdanau, Cho and Bengio (2014) has been adapted to APC task in
the last few years. ATAE-LSTM takes the feature representation of aspects and context words as the input of the
model and applies an attention mechanism to dynamically calculate the attention weight according to the relationship
between aspects and context words, and finally predicts the polarity of aspects according to the weighted context

features. Another LSTM-based model IAN Ma et al. (2017) deployed with attention mechanism equips two independent LSTM networks to capture the features of the context and aspect, with interactively integrating and learning
the inner correlation of the features of context and targeted aspects. The RAM Chen et al. (2017a) is a bi-directional
LSTM-based architecture deploys a multi-layer deep neural network with dedicated memory layers. The multi-layer
network utilizes the token features learned based on the attention mechanism and GRUs to finally obtain the global
semantic features of the text to predict the sentiment polarities of targeted aspects. In order to retard the loss of
context features during the training process, TNet Li et al. (2018) introduced a conventional transformation architecture based on context-preserving transformation (CPT) units. TNet integrates the bidirectional LSTM network and
convolutional neural network and significantly improves the accuracy of sentiment polarity prediction. Multi-grained
attention network Fan et al. (2018) (MGAN) is a new deep neural network model, which equips with a variety of finegrained attention mechanisms, and applies the fine-grained attention mechanisms to interactively learn the token-level
features between aspects and context, making great use of the inherent semantic correlation of aspects and context.

Peng, Ma, Li and Cambria (2018) proposed the methods for the Chinese language APC task, which conducted the
APC task at the aspect level via three granularities. Two fusion methods for the granularities in the Chinese APC task
are introduced and applied. Empirical results show that the proposed methods achieved promising performance on the
most commonly used ABSA datasets and four Chinese review datasets. Meanwhile, a joint framework aimed to aspect
sentiment classification subtask and aspect-opinion pair identification subtask is proposedby Chen and Huang (2019),
in which the external knowledge are considered and put into the network to alleviate the problem of insufficient train
data. The gated alternate neural network (GANN) Liu and Shen (2019) proposed for APC task aimed to solve the
shortcomings of traditional RNNs and CNNs. The GANN applied the gate truncation RNN (GTR) to learn the aspectdependent sentiment clue representations. Zeng, Ma, Chen and Li (2019b) proposed an end-to-end neural network
model for the ABSA task based on joint learning, and the experimental results on a Chinese review show that the
proposed model works fine while conducting ATE and APC subtask simultaneously.

BERT-SPC is the BERT text pair classification model, it is a variation model of Bert and is adapted to solve the
ABSA task in Song et al. (2019) and achieve high performance. LCF-Bert Zeng et al. (2019a) proposed a featurelevel local context focus mechanism based on self-attention, which can be applied to aspect level emotion analysis and
many other fine-grained natural language processing tasks. BERT-ADA Rietzler, Stabinger, Opitz and Engl (2019)
shows that although the pre-trained model based on a large universal corpus, and is easy to be applied to most tasks
and improve performance. Still, it is not task-specific. For specific tasks, if the pre-trained BERT is adapted to specific
tasks through the fine-tuning process on a task-related corpus, the task performance can be further improved.

3. Methodology

Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies on the targeted aspects, and most existing studies focus on the classification
of aspect polarity, leaving the problem of aspect term extraction. To propose an effective aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on multi-task learning, we adopted domain-adapted BERT model from BERT-ADA and integrated
the local context focus mechanism into the proposed model. This section introduces the architecture and methodology
of LCF-ATEPC.

This section introduces the methodology of the APC module and the ATE module, respectively. and the contents
are organized by order of the network layer hierarchy.

3.1. Task Definition
3.1.1, Aspect Term Extraction

Similar to name entity recognition (NER) task, the ATE task is a kind of sequence labeling task, and prepare the
input based on IOB labels. We design the IOB labels as Basps I aap O, and the labels indicate the beginning, inside
and outside of the aspect terms, respectively. For ATE task, the input of the example review “The price is reasonable
although the service is poor.” will be prepared as S = {w,,wW,-:: w,}, and w stands for a token after tokenization,
n = 10 is the total number of tokens. The example will be labeled in Y = {O, B,.,,O,O0,O,O, B,.,,O,O,O}.

3.1.2. Aspect Polarity Classification

Aspect polarity classification is a multi-grained sub-task of sentiment analysis, aiming at predicting the aspect
polarity for targeted aspects. Suppose that “The price is reasonable although the service is poor. ” is the input
for APC task, consistently with ATE task, S = {w,,wW,--- w,} stands for all the token of the review, and S’ =

respectively.

3.2. Model Architecture

Aiming at the problem of insufficient research on aspect term extraction task, a joint deep learning model is
designed in this section. This model combines aspect polarity classification task and aspect term extraction task,
and two independent Bert layers are adopted to model the global context and the local context respectively. For
conducting multi-task training at the same time, the input sequences are tokenized into different tokens and the each
token is assigned two kinds of label. The first label indicates whether the token belongs to an aspect; the second label
marks the polarity of the tokens belongs to the aspect.

Fig 2 is the network architecture of LCF-ATEPC. Local context feature generator (LCFG) unit is on the left
and a global context feature generator (GCFG) unit is on the right. Both context feature generator units contain
an independent pre-trained BERT layer, BERT! and BERT® respectively. The LCFG unit extracts the features of
the local context by a local context focus layer and a MHSA encoder. The GCFG unit deploys only one MHSA
encoder to learn the global context feature. The feature interactive learning (FIL) layer combines the learning of the
interaction between local context features and global context features and predicts the sentiment polarity of aspects.
The extraction of aspects based on the features of the global context.

3.2.1. BERT-Shared Layer

The pre-trained BERT model is designed to improve performance for most NLP tasks, and The LCF-ATEPC
model deploys two independent BERT-Shared layers that are aimed to extract local and global context features. For
pre-trained BERT, the fine-tuning learning process is indispensable. Both BERT-Shared layers are regarded as embed

ded layers, and the fine-tuning process is conducted independently according to the joint loss function of multi-task
learning. X! and X& are used to represent the tokenized inputs of LCFG and GCFG respectively, and we can obtain
the preliminary outputs of local and global context features.

Operr and Opp are the output features of the LCFG and the GCEG, respectively. BERT’ and BERT® are

the corresponding BERT-shared layer embedded in the LCFG and the GCFG respectively.

3.3. Multi-Head Self-Attention

Multi-head self-attention is based on multiple scale-dot attention (SDA), which can be utilized to extract deep
semantic features in the context, and the features are represented in self-attention score. The MHSA can avoids the
negative influence caused by the long distance dependence of the context when learning the features. Suppose X 5p 4
is the input features learned by the LCFG. The scale-dot attention is calculate as follows:

SDA(Xgpa) = Sof tmax ( -V (3)
Q, KV = f,(Xspa) (4)

Q=Xspa' WwW"
fy(Xspa)=4 K=Xsp,:W* (5)
V=Xgp,:'W”

Q, K and V are the abstract matrices packed from the input features of SDA by three weight matrices W, €

the output features, then transform the features by multiplying a vector W™". h represents the number of the attention
heads and equal to 12.

MHS A(X) = tanh ({H);...;H,}-w"™") (6)

The “;” means feature concatenation of each head. W!@"¥ € R’4u*4n is the parameter matrices for projection . Additionally, we apply a tanh activation function for the MHSA learning process, which significantly enhanced featurecapture capability.

3.4. Local Context Focus
3.4.1. Semantic-Relative Distance

The determination of local context depends on semantic-relative distance (SRD), which is proposed to determine
whether the context word belongs to the local context of a targeted aspect to help the model capture the local context.
Local context is a new concept that can be adapted to most fine-grained NLP tasks. In the ABSA field, existing
models generally segment input sequences into aspect sequences and context sequences, treat aspects and context as
independent segments and model their characteristics separately. Instead of leaving the aspect alone as part of the
input, this paper mines the aspect and its local context, because the empirical result shows the local context of the
target aspect contains more important information.

SRD is a concept based on token-aspect pairs, describing how far a token is from the aspect. It counts the number
of tokens between each specific token towards a targeted aspect as the SRD of all token-aspect pairs. The SRD is
calculated as:

SRD, =|i-P,|- 5) (7)

where i (1 < i < n) is the position of the specific token, P,, is the central position of aspect. m is the length of targeted
aspect, and S RD; represents for the SRD between the i-th token and the targeted aspect.

Figure 3 and Figure 4 are two implementations of the local context focus mechanism, the context-feature dynamic mask (CDM) layer and context-feature dynamic weighting (CDW) layer, respectively. The bottom and top of
the figures represent the feature input and output positions (POS) corresponding to each token. The self-attention
mechanism treats all tokens equally, so that each token can generate the self-attention score with other tokens through
parallel matrix operation. According to the definition of MHSA, the features of the output position corresponding to
each token are more closely related to itself. After calculating the output of all tokens by MHSA encoder, the output
features of each output position will be masked or attenuated, except that the local context will be retained intact.

3.4.2. Context-features Dynamic Mask

Apart from to the features of the local context, the CDM layer will mask non-local context’s features learned by the
BERT' layer. Although it is easy to directly mask the non-local context words in the input sequence, it is inevitable
to discard the features of non-local context words. As the CDM layer is deployed, only a relatively small amount of
the semantic context itself will be masked at the corresponding output position. The relative representation of context
words and aspects with relatively few semantics is preserved in the corresponding output position.

According to the CDM implementation, the features on all the positions of non-local context words will be set to
zero vectors. In order to avoid the unbalanced distribution of features after the CDM operation, an MHSA encoder is

 

Yang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 7 of 18
utilized to learn and rebalance the masked local context features. Suppose that the Ogprpzi is the preliminary output
features of BE RT’, then we get the local context feature output as follows,

_f E SRD,<a (8)
' ) O SRD,>a

M = (|V.",V3",...V"| (9)

Oupm = Oserr':M (10)

To mask the features of non-local context, we defines a feature masking matrix M, and vin is the mask vectors
for each token in the input sequence. a is the SRD threshold and n is the length of input sequence including aspect.
Tokens whose SRD regarding to the targeted aspect is less than the threshold a are the local contexts. The E € R%
represents the ones vector and O € R%* is the zeros vectors. “.” denotes the dot-product operation of the vectors.

O' = MHSA(Ocny) (11)
Finally the local context features learned by the CDM layer are delivered as O!.

3.4.3. Context-features Dynamic Weighting

Although empirical results show that the CDM has achieved excellent performance compared with existing models, we design the CDW to explore the potential of LCF mechanism. The CDW is another implementation of the
LCF mechanism, takes a more modest strategy compared to the CDM layer, which simply drops the features of the
non-local context completely. While the features of local context retained intact, the features of the non-local context
words will be weighted decay according to their SRD concerning a targeted aspect.

to extract the hidden states on the corresponding position of the first token in the input sequence. then a Softmax

3.8. Training Details

The LCFG and the GCFG are based on the BERT-BASE and BERT-SPC models, respectively. And the BERTSPC Song et al. (2019) significantly improved the performance of APC tasks. In LCF-ATEPC, BERT-SPC only
refactored the input sequence form compared with BERT-BASE model. The input sequence of BERT-BASE is formed
in “[CLS]” + sequence + “[SEP]”, while it is formed in “[CLS]” + sequence + “[SEP]” + aspect + “[SEP]” for
BERT-SPC.

Since LCF-ATEPC is a multi-task learning model, we redesigned the form of data input and adopted dual labels
of sentiment polarity and token category. The Figure 5 are the input samples of BERT-BASE and BERT-SPC model,
respectively.

4. Experiments

4.1. Datasets and Hyperparameters Setting

To comprehensive evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the experiments were conducted in three
most commonly used ABSA datasets, the Laptops and Restaurant datasets of SemEval-2014 Task4 subtask2 Pontiki
et al. (2014) and an ACL Twitter social dataset Dong, Wei, Tan, Tang, Zhou and Xu (2014). To evaluate our model
capability with processing the Chinese language, we also tested the performance of LCF-ATEPC on four Chinese
comment datasets Che, Zhao, Guo, Su and Liu (2015); Zhao, Pan, Du and Zheng (2015b); Peng et al. (2018) (Car,
Phone, Notebook, Camera). We preprocessed the seven datasets. We reformatted the origin dataset and annotated each

sample with the IOB labels for ATE task and polarity labels for APC tasks, respectively. The polarity of each aspect
on the Laptops, Restaurants and datasets may be positive, neutral, and negative, and the conflicting labels of polarity
are not considered. The reviews in the four Chinese datasets have been purged, with each aspect may be positive or
negative binary polarity. To verify the effectiveness and performance of LCF-ATEPC models on multilingual datasets,
we built a multilingual dataset by mixing the 7 datasets. We adopt this dataset to conduct multilingual-oriented ATE
and APC experiments.

The table demonstrates the details of these datasets’.

different SRD.

4.2. Compared Methods

We compare the LCF-ATEPC model to current state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance both in the ATE and APC tasks.
ATAE-LSTM Wang et al. (2016) is a classical LSTM-based network for the APC task, which applies the attention
mechanism to focus on the important words in the context. Besides, ATAE-LSTM appends aspect embedding and
the learned features to make full use of the aspect features. The ATAE-LSTM can be adapted to the Chinese review
datasets.
ATSM-S Peng et al. (2018) is a baseline model of the ATSM variations for Chinese language-oriented ABSA task.
This model learns the sentence and aspect terms at three perspectives of granularity.
GANN is novel neural network model for APC task aimed to solve the shortcomings of traditional RNNs and CNNs.

The GANN applied the Gate Truncation RNN (GTR) to learn informative aspect-dependent sentiment clue representations. GANN obtained the state-of-the-art APC performance on the Chinese review datasets.

AEN-BERT Song et al. (2019) is an attentional encoder network based on the pretrained BERT model, which aims
to solve the aspect polarity classification.

BERT-BASE Devlin et al. (2019) is the basic pretrained BERT model. We adapt it to ABSA multi-task learning,
which equips the same ability to automatically extract aspect terms and classify aspects polarity as LCF-ATEPC
model.

BERT-SPC Song et al. (2019) is a pretrained BERT model designed for the sentence-pair classification task. Consistent with the basic BERT model, we implemented this model for ABSA multitasking.

BERT-ADA Rietzler et al. (2019) is a domain-adapted BERT-based model proposed for the APC task, which finetuned the BERT-BASE model on task-related corpus. This model obtained state-of-the-art accuracy on the Laptops
dataset.

LCF-ATEPC? is the multi-task learning model for the ATE and APC tasks, which is based on the the BERT-SPC
model and local context focus mechanism.

LCF-ATE are the variations of the LCF-ATEPC model which only optimize for the ATE task.

LCF-APC are the variations of LCF-ATEPC and it only optimize for the APC task during training process.

4.3. Results Analysis

The experiments are conducted in several segments. First, the baseline performance of LCF-ATEPC on all Chinese
and English data sets was tested, and then the effectiveness of multi-task learning was demonstrated. Finally, the
assistance of domain-adapted BERT model in improving performance was evaluated and the sensitivity of different

4.4. Overall Performance Analysis

Many models for ABSA tasks do not take into account the ATE subtask, but there are still some joint models
Nguyen and Shirai (2018) based on the traditional neural network architecture to conduct the APC and ATE tasks
simultaneously. Benefit from the joint training process, the two ABSA subtasks of APC and ATE can promote each
other and improve the performance.

The CDM layer works better on twitter dataset because there are a lot of non-standard grammar usage and language
abbreviations within it, and the local context focus techniques can promote to infer the polarity of terms. Surprisingly,
for the Laptop and Restaurant datasets, guests occasionally have a unified “global” view in a specific review. That is,
if the customer is not satisfied with one aspect, it is likely to criticize the other. Things will be the same if a customer
prefers a restaurant he would be tolerant of some small disamenity, so the CDW mechanism performs better because
it does not completely mask the local context of the other aspect. In the multi-task learning process, the convergence
rate of APC and ATE tasks is different, so the model does not achieve the optimal effect at the same time.

We build a joint model for the multi-task of ATE and APC based on the BERT-BASE model. After optimizing
the model parameters according to the empirical result, the joint model based on BERT-BASE achieved hopeful
performance on all three datasets and even surpassed other proposed BERT based improved models on some datasets,
such as BERT-PT, AEN-BERT, SDGCN-BERT, and so on. Meanwhile, we implement the joint-task model based on
BERT-SPC. Compared with the BERT-BASE model, BERT-SPC significantly improves the accuracy and F1 score of
aspect polarity classification. In addition, for the first time, BERT-SPC has increased the F1 score of ATE subtask on
three datasets up to 99%.

ATEPC-Fusion is a supplementary scheme of LCF mechanism, and it adopts a moderate approach to generate
local context features. The experimental results show that its performance is also better than the existing BERT-based
models.

4.4.1. Effectiveness of Multi-task Learning

Keeping the main architecture of the LCF-ATEPC model unchanged, we tried to only optimize parameters for a
single task in the multi-task model to explore the difference between the optimal performance of a single task and the
multi-task learning model °.

The Figure 5 depicts the performance of the LCF-ATEPC model when performing an single APC or ATE task.
Experimental results show that on some datasets the LCF-ATEPC model performs better concerning APC or ATE
single task than conducting ABSA multi-task on some datasets. In general, the proposed model LCF-ATEPC proposed
in this paper is still superior to other ABSA-oriented multi-task models and even the single-task models aim to APC or
ATE. When optimizing the model parameters for through back-propagation of multiple tasks, the multi-task learning
model needs to take into account multiple loss functions of the different subtasks. So sometimes the multi-task

The BERT-BASE model is trained on a large-scale general corpus, so the fine-tuning during process during training
process is significant and inevitable for BERT-based models. Meanwhile, the ABSA datasets commonly benchmarked
are generally small with the domain-specific characteristic, the effect of BERT-BASE model on the most ABSA
datasets can be further improved through domain-adaption. Domain adaption is a effective technique while integrating
the pre-trained BERT-BASE model. By further training the BERT-BASE model in a domain-related corpus similar to
or homologous to the target ABSA dataset, then domain-related pretrained BERT model can be obtained. We adopted
the method proposed in Rietzler et al. (2019) to obtain the domain-adapted pre-trained BERT model based on the
corpus of Yelp Dataset Challenge reviews’ and the amazon Laptops review datasetHe and McAuley (2016). Table
6 shows that the performance of APC task significantly improved by domain-adapted BERT model. The accuracy
benchmark in the classical Restaurant achieving more than 90%, which means that the LCF-ATEPC is the first ABSAoriented model obtained up to 90% accuracy on the Restaurant dataset. In addition, experimental result on the Laptop
dataset also prove the effectiveness of domain-adaption in multi-task learning. Besides, the experimental results on
the laptop dataset also validate the effectiveness of domain-adapted BERT model for ABSA multi-task learning.

We tested the sensitivity of SRD threshold on the typical Chinese and English ABSA datasets: the Phone dataset
and The Restaurant dataset, respectively. Besides, for the evaluation of the restaurant dataset, we adopted the domainadapted BERT model as the underlying architecture of the LCF-ATEPC model. The experimental result of Figure 6,

For the Chinese Phone dataset, the LCF-ATEPC-CDM model can achieve the best APC accuracy and F1 score
when the SRD threshold is about 4-5, while the best ATE task performance reaches the highest when the SRD threshold is about 1-3. The LCF-ATEPC-CDW model obtains the best APC performance on the Phone dataset when the
SRD threshold is 5, while the best ATE F1 score is approximately obtained when the SRD threshold is 7.

For the Restaurant dataset, the optimal APC accuracy and F1 score achieved by LCF-ATEPC-CDM while the
SRD threshold is approximately between 4 and 6. While the SRD threshold for the LCF-ATEPC-CDW is set to 8, the
model achieves the optimal aspect classification accuracy and F1 score. However, the F1 score of the ATE task is less
sensitive to the SRD threshold, indicating that aspect polarity classification task has less assistance on it during the
joint learning process.

5. Conclusion

The ATE and APC subtasks were treated as independent tasks in previous studies. Moreover, the multi-task
learning model for ATE and APC subtasks has not attracted enough attention from researchers. Besides, the researches
concerning the Chinese language-oriented ABSA task are not sufficient and urgent to be proposed and developed. To
address the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-task learning model LCF-ATEPC for aspect-based sentiment
analysis based on the MHSA and the LCF mechanisms and applies the pre-trained BERT to the ATE sub-tasks for the
first time. Not only for the Chinese language, but the models proposed in this paper are multilingual and applicable
to the classic English review sentiment analysis task, such as the SemEval-2014 task4. The proposed model can
automatically extract aspects from reviews and infer aspects’ polarity. Empirical results on 3 commonly English
datasets and four Chinese review datasets for ABSA tasks show that, compared with all models based on basic BERT,
the LCF-ATEPC model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ATE and APC tasks.
