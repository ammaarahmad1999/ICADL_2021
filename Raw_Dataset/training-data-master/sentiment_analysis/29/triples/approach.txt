(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||models||aspects and texts simultaneously)
(aspects and texts simultaneously||using||LSTMs)
(Approach||based on||long short - term memory ( LSTM ) neural networks)
(Approach||choose||AOA)
(AOA||to attend||most important parts)
(most important parts||in both||aspect and sentence)
(Approach||has||AOA)
(AOA||automatically generates||mutual attentions)
(mutual attentions||but also||text - to - aspect)
(mutual attentions||not only from||aspect - to - text)
(Approach||has||target representation and text representation)
(target representation and text representation||generated from||LSTMs)
(target representation and text representation||interact with||each other)
(each other||by||attention - over - attention ( AOA ) module)
