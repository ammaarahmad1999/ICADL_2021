(Contribution||has||Ablation analysis)
(Ablation analysis||running||transitive closure module)
(transitive closure module||after||temporal rule - based sieve ( RB + TR ))
(temporal rule - based sieve ( RB + TR )||results in||improving recall)
(Ablation analysis||Combining||rule - based and machine - learned sieves ( RB + ML ))
(rule - based and machine - learned sieves ( RB + ML )||yields||slight improvement)
(slight improvement||compared with||enabling only the machine - learned sieve)
(enabling only the machine - learned sieve||in||system ( ML ))
(Ablation analysis||Introducing||temporal reasoner module)
(temporal reasoner module||between||two sieves ( RB + TR + ML ))
(two sieves ( RB + TR + ML )||proves to be||even more beneficial)
