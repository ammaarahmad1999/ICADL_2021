(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||means that||neural attention model)
(neural attention model||effectively exploit||combination of semantic similarity - based attention and positionbased attention)
(Model||has||architecture)
(architecture||better customized for||slot filling task)
(architecture||has||word representations)
(word representations||augmented by||extra distributed representations of word position)
