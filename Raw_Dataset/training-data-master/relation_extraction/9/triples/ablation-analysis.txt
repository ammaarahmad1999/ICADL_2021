(Contribution||has||Ablation analysis)
(Ablation analysis||observe that||all three of our components)
(all three of our components||lead to||noticeable improvements)
(noticeable improvements||over||baselines)
(Ablation analysis||evaluating||several simplified models)
(several simplified models||has||first simplification)
(first simplification||to use||model)
(model||with||pooling attention layer)
(model||without||input attention mechanism)
(several simplified models||has||third)
(third||uses||regular objective function)
(regular objective function||based on||inner product s = r w)
(inner product s = r w||for||sentence representation r)
(inner product s = r w||for||relation class embedding w)
(third||removes||both forms of attention)
(several simplified models||has||second)
(second||removes||both attention mechanisms)
