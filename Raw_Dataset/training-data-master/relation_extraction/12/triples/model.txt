(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||introduce||dense connections)
(dense connections||to||GCN model)
(Model||For||GCNs)
(GCNs||has||L layers)
(L layers||to capture||neighborhood information)
(neighborhood information||that is||L hops away)
(Model||develop||" soft pruning " strategy)
(" soft pruning " strategy||that transforms||original dependency tree)
(original dependency tree||into||fully connected edgeweighted graph)
(Model||has||weights)
(weights||viewed as||strength of relatedness)
(strength of relatedness||can be learned in||end - to - end fashion)
(end - to - end fashion||by using||self - attention mechanism)
(strength of relatedness||between||nodes)
(Model||propose||novel Attention Guided Graph Convolutional Networks ( AGGCNs ))
(novel Attention Guided Graph Convolutional Networks ( AGGCNs )||operate directly on||full tree)
(Model||With the help of||dense connections)
(dense connections||able to||train)
(train||has||AGGCN model)
(AGGCN model||with||large depth)
