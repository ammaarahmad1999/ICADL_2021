(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||adopts||feed - forward network)
(feed - forward network||based on||self - attention in Transformer and 1D convolution)
(Model||adopts||length regulator)
(length regulator||up - samples||phoneme sequence according to the phoneme duration)
(phoneme sequence according to the phoneme duration||to match||length of the mel-spectrogram sequence)
(length regulator||built on||phoneme duration predictor)
(phoneme duration predictor||predicts||duration of each phoneme)
(Model||propose||FastSpeech)
(FastSpeech||generates||mel-spectrograms non-autoregressively)
(FastSpeech||takes||text ( phoneme ) sequence as input)
