(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||to decouple||speaker modeling)
(speaker modeling||from||speech synthesis)
(speaker modeling||by independently training||speaker - discriminative embedding network)
(speaker - discriminative embedding network||captures||space of speaker characteristics)
(speaker modeling||training||high quality TTS model)
(high quality TTS model||conditioned on||representation learned by the first network)
(high quality TTS model||on||smaller dataset)
(Approach||trained on||untranscribed speech)
(untranscribed speech||containing||reverberation and background noise)
(reverberation and background noise||from||large number of speakers)
(Approach||train||speaker embedding network)
(speaker embedding network||on||speaker verification task)
(speaker verification task||to determine||two different utterances were spoken by the same speaker)
