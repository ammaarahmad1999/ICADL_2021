(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||shows that||results)
(results||of||LSTM - CRF)
(LSTM - CRF||are||significantly improved)
(significantly improved||after adding||character - to - word models)
(Results||has||Character - to - word Models)
(Character - to - word Models||add||residual connections)
(residual connections||to||char - CNN - 9)
(char - CNN - 9||as||char - ResNet - 9)
(char - CNN - 9||confirms that||residual connections)
(residual connections||help train||deep layers)
(Character - to - word Models||improve||char - ResNet - 9)
(char - ResNet - 9||by changing||residual connections)
(residual connections||into||dense connection blocks)
(dense connection blocks||as||char - DenseNet - 9)
(dense connection blocks||shows that||dense connections)
(dense connections||are||better)
(better||than||residual connections)
(residual connections||for learning||word shape information)
(Character - to - word Models||has||proposed character - to - word model , char - IntNet - 5 and char - IntNet - 9)
(proposed character - to - word model , char - IntNet - 5 and char - IntNet - 9||improves||results)
(results||across||all datasets)
(Character - to - word Models||has||IntNet)
(IntNet||significantly outperforms||other character embedding models)
(Character - to - word Models||has||F1 score)
(F1 score||does not||improve much)
(improve much||when||directly add)
(directly add||has||more layers)
(Character - to - word Models||observe||char - IntNet - 5)
(char - IntNet - 5||is||more effective)
(more effective||for learning||character - to - word representations)
(character - to - word representations||in||most of the cases)
(character - to - word representations||than||char - IntNet - 9)
(Character - to - word Models||observe||some accuracy drop)
(some accuracy drop||when||continuously increase)
(continuously increase||has||depth)
(Results||has||IntNet)
(IntNet||improves||F - 1 score)
(F - 1 score||over||stateof - the - art results)
(F - 1 score||by more than||2 %)
(2 %||for||Dutch and Spanish)
(Results||in comparison with||state - of - the - art results)
(state - of - the - art results||show that||our char - IntNet)
(our char - IntNet||improves||results)
(results||across||different models and datasets)
