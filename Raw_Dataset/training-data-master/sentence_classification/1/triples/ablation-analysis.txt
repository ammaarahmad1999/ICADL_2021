(Contribution||has||Ablation analysis)
(Ablation analysis||When||context enriching layer)
(context enriching layer||is||removed)
(removed||has||both models)
(both models||experience||most significant performance drop)
(both models||on par with||previous stateof - the - art results)
(Ablation analysis||has||HSLN - CNN model)
(HSLN - CNN model||suffers a little more from||component removal)
(HSLN - CNN model||than||HSLN - RNN model)
(Ablation analysis||has||dropout regularization and attention - based pooling components)
(dropout regularization and attention - based pooling components||further improve||model)
(model||in||limited extent)
(dropout regularization and attention - based pooling components||add to||our system)
(Ablation analysis||even without||label sequence optimization layer)
(label sequence optimization layer||has||our model)
(our model||significantly outperforms||best published methods)
(best published methods||empowered by||this layer)
