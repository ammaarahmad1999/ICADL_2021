Abstract

Identifying the intent of a citation in sclientific papers (e.g., background information,
use of methods, comparing results) is critical for machine reading of individual publications and automated analysis of the scientific literature. We propose structural scaffolds, a multitask model to incorporate structural information of scientific papers into citations for effective classification of citation
intents. Our model achieves a new state-ofthe-art on an existing ACL anthology dataset
(ACL-ARC) with a 13.3% absolute increase
in Fl score, without relying on external linguistic resources or hand-engineered features
as done in existing methods. In addition, we
introduce a new dataset of citation intents (SciCite) which is more than five times larger and
covers multiple scientific domains compared
with existing datasets. Our code and data
are available at: https://github.com/
allenai/scicite.

1 Introduction

Citations play a unique role in scientific discourse
and are crucial for understanding and analyzing
scientific work (Luukkonen, 1992; Leydesdorff,
1998). They are also typically used as the main
measure for assessing impact of scientific publications, venues, and researchers (Li and Ho,
2008). The nature of citations can be different.
Some citations indicate direct use of a method
while some others merely serve as acknowledging a prior work. Therefore, identifying the intent of citations (Figure 1) is critical in improving
automated analysis of academic literature and scientific impact measurement (Leydesdorff, 1998;
Small, 2018). Other applications of citation intent classification are enhanced research experience (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975), information retrieval (Ritchie, 2009), summarization (Co

of scientific fields (Jurgens et al., 2018).

In this work, we approach the problem of citation intent classification by modeling the language expressed in the citation context. A clitation context includes text spans in a citing paper describing a referenced work and has been
shown to be the primary signal in intent classification (Teufel et al., 2006; Abu-Jbara et al., 2013;
Jurgens et al., 2018). Existing models for this
problem are feature-based, modeling the citation
context with respect to a set of predefined handengineered features (such as linguistic patterns or
cue phrases) and ignoring other signals that could
improve prediction.

In this paper we argue that better representations can be obtained directly from data, sidestepping problems associated with external features.
To this end, we propose a neural multitask learning framework to incorporate knowledge into citations from the structure of scientific papers. In
particular, we propose two auxiliary tasks as structural scaffolds to improve citation intent prediction:! (1) predicting the section title in which the
citation occurs and (2) predicting whether a sentence needs a citation. Unlike the primary task of
citation intent prediction, it is easy to collect large

amounts of training data for scaffold tasks since
the labels naturally occur in the process of writing a paper and thus, there is no need for manual
annotation. On two datasets, we show that the proposed neural scaffold model outperforms existing
methods by large margins.

Our contributions are: (i) we propose a neural scaffold framework for citation intent classification to incorporate into citations knowledge
from structure of scientific papers; (ii) we achieve
a new State-of-the-art of 67.9% F1 on the ACLARC citations benchmark, an absolute 13.3% increase over the previous state-of-the-art (Jurgens
et al., 2018); and (iii) we introduce SciCite, a new
dataset of citation intents which is at least five
times as large as existing datasets and covers a variety of scientific domains.

2 Model

We propose a neural multitask learning framework
for classification of citation intents. In particular, we introduce and use two structural scaffolds,
auxiliary tasks related to the structure of scientific
papers. The auxiliary tasks may not be of interest by themselves but are used to inform the main
task. Our model uses a large auxiliary dataset to
incorporate this structural information available in
scientific documents into the citation intents. The
overview of our model is illustrated in Figure 2.
Let C’ denote the citation and x denote the ci
tation context relevant to C’. We encode the tokens in the citation context of size n as x =
{x1,...,Xn}, where x; € R”™ is a word vector
of size d, which concatenates non-contextualized
word representations (GloVe, Pennington et al.,
2014) and contextualized embeddings (ELMo, Peters et al., 2018), 1.e.:
xX; = [plore x Me]
We then use a bidirectional long short-term memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) (BiLSTM) network with hidden size of d2 to obtain
a contextual representation of each token vector
with respect to the entire sequence:

h; = [LSTM (x, i); ESTM (x, i)],

where h € R‘":?42) and LSTM(x, 7) processes x
from left to write and returns the LSTM hidden
state at position 7 (and vice versa for the backward
direction LS'T'M). We then use an attention mechanism to get a single vector representing the whole
input sequence:

nr
Z= Ss” ajhj, aj; = softmax(w | h,),
i=1

where w is a parameter served as the query vector for dot-product attention.*> So far we have obtained the citation representation as a vector z.
Next, we describe our two proposed structural
scaffolds for citation intent prediction.

2.1 Structural scaffolds

In scientific writing there is a connection between
the structure of scientific papers and the intent of
citations. To leverage this connection for more effective classification of citation intents, we propose a multitask framework with two structural
scaffolds (auxiliary tasks) related to the structure
of scientific documents. A key point for our proposed scaffolds is that they do not need any additional manual annotation as labels for these tasks
occur naturally in scientific writing. The structural
scaffolds in our model are the following:

“In our experiments BiGRUs resulted in similar performance.

*We also experimented BiLSTMs without attention; we
found that BiLSTMs/BiGRUs along with attention provided
best results. Other types of attention such as additive attention result in similar performance.
Citation worthiness. The first scaffold task that
we consider is “citation worthiness” of a sentence,
indicating whether a sentence needs a citation.
The language expressed in citation sentences is
likely distinctive from regular sentences in scientific writing, and such information could also be
useful for better language modeling of the citation
contexts. To this end, using citation markers such
as “[12]” or “Lee et al (2010)”, we identify sentences in a paper that include citations and the negative samples are sentences without citation markers. The goal of the model for this task is to predict
whether a particular sentence needs a citation.*

Section title. The second scaffold task relates
to predicting the section title in which a citation
appears. Scientific documents follow a standard
structure where the authors typically first introduce the problem, describe methodology, share results, discuss findings and conclude the paper. The
intent of a citation could be relevant to the section
of the paper in which the citation appears. For example, method-related citations are more likely to
appear in the methods section. Therefore, we use
the section title prediction as a scaffold for predicting citation intents. Note that this scaffold task
is different than simply adding section title as an
additional feature in the input. We are using the
section titles from a larger set of data than training
data for the main task as a proxy to learn linguistic patterns that are helpful for citation intents. In
particular, we leverage a large number of scientific
papers for which the section information is known
for each citation to automatically generate large
amounts of training data for this scaffold task.>

Multitask formulation. Multitask learning as
defined by Caruana (1997) is an approach to inductive transfer learning that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in
the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It requires the model to have at least
some sharable parameters between the tasks. In
a general setting in our model, we have a main
task Task) and n — 1 auxiliary tasks Task”.
As shown in Figure 2, each scaffold task will have
its task-specific parameters for effective classifica

>We also experimented with adding section titles as additional feature to the input, however, it did not result in any
improvements.

tion and the parameters for the lower layers of the
network are shared across tasks. We use a Multi
Layer Perceptron (MLP) for each task and then a
softmax layer to obtain prediction probabilites. In
particular, given the vector z we pass it ton MLPs
and obtain n output vectors y:

y") = softmax(MLP (z))

We are only interested in the output y“) and
the rest of outputs (y), ..., y’) are regarding the
scaffold tasks and only used in training to inform
the model of knowledge in the structure of the scientific documents. For each task, we output the
class with the highest probability in y. An alternative inference method is to sample from the output
distribution.

2.2 Training

Let D; be the labeled dataset for the main task
Task“), and D; denote the labeled datasets corresponding to the scaffold task Task) where i €
{2,...,n}. Similarly, let £; and £; be the main
loss and the loss of the auxiliary task 7, respectively. The final loss of the model is:

L= S- Li(x,y)+ Sod S- Li (x,y), (1)

where A; is a hyper-parameter specifying the sensitivity of the parameters of the model to each specific task. Here we have two scaffold tasks and
hence n=3. A; could be tuned based on performance on validation set (see $4 for details).

We train this model jointly across tasks and in
an end-to-end fashion. In each training epoch, we
construct mini-batches with the same number of
instances from each of the n tasks. We compute
the total loss for each mini-batch as described in
Equation 1, where £;=0 for all instances of other
tasks 747. We compute the gradient of the loss for
each mini-batch and tune model parameters using
the AdaDelta optimizer (Zeiler, 2012) with gradient clipping threshold of 5.0. We stop training the
model when the development macro F1 score does
not improve for five consecutive epochs.

3 Data

We compare our results on two datasets from different scientific domains. While there has been a
long history of studying citation intents, there are
only a few existing publicly available datasets on

the task of citation intent classification. We use the
most recent and comprehensive (ACL-ARC citations dataset) by Jurgens et al. (2018) as a benchmark dataset to compare the performance of our
model to previous work. In addition, to address
the limited scope and size of this dataset, we introduce SciCite, a new dataset of citation intents that
addresses multiple scientific domains and is more
than five times larger than ACL-ARC. Below is a
description of both datasets.

3.1 ACL-ARC citations dataset

ACL-ARC is a dataset of citation intents released
by Jurgens et al. (2018). The dataset is based on a
sample of papers from the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008) and includes 1,941
citation instances from 186 papers and is annotated by domain experts in the NLP field. The
data was split into three standard stratified sets of
train, validation, and test with 85% of data used
for training and remaining 15% divided equally
for validation and test. Each citation unit includes
information about the immediate citation context,
surrounding context, as well as information about
the citing and cited paper. The data includes six
intent categories outlined in Table 2.

3.2 SciCite dataset

Most existing datasets contain citation categories
that are too fine-grained. Some of these intent categories are very rare or not useful in meta analysis of scientific publications. Since some of these
fine-grained categories only cover a minimal percentage of all citations, it is difficult to use them
to gain insights or draw conclusions on impacts
of papers. Furthermore, these datasets are usually
domain-specific and are relatively small (less than
2,000 annotated citations).

To address these limitations, we introduce SciCite, a new dataset of citation intents that is significantly larger, more coarse-grained and generaldomain compared with existing datasets. Through
examination of citation intents, we found out many
of the categories defined in previous work such
aS motivation, extension or future work, can be
considered as background information providing
more context for the current research topic. More
interesting intent categories are a direct use of a
method or comparison of results. Therefore, our
dataset provides a concise annotation scheme that
is useful for navigating research topics and machine reading of scientific papers. We consider
three intent categories outlined in Table 1: BACKGROUND, METHOD and RESULTCOMPARISON.
Below we describe data collection and annotation
details.

3.2.1 Data collection and annotation

Semantic Scholar corpus,’ consisting of papers in
general computer science and medicine domains.
Citation contexts were extracted using science

platform/
Thttps://semanticscholar.org/
parse.® The annotators were asked to identify the
intent of a citation, and were directed to select
among three citation intent options: METHOD,
RESULTCOMPARISON and BACKGROUND. The
annotation interface also included a dummy option OTHER which helps improve the quality of
annotations of other categories. We later removed
instances annotated with the OTHER option from
our dataset (less than 1% of the annotated data),
many of which were due to citation contexts which
are incomplete or too short for the annotator to 1nfer the citation intent.

We used 50 test questions annotated by a domain expert to ensure crowdsource workers were
following directions and disqualify annotators
with accuracy less than 75%. Furthermore, crowdsource workers were required to remain on the annotation page (five annotations) for at least ten seconds before proceeding to the next page. Annotations were dynamically collected. The annotations
were aggregated along with a confidence score describing the level of agreement between multiple
crowdsource workers. The confidence score is the
agreement on a single instance weighted by a trust
score (accuracy of the annotator on the initial 50
test questions).

To only collect high quality annotations, instances with confidence score of <0.7 were discarded. In addition, a subset of the dataset with
100 samples was re-annotated by a trained, expert
annotator to check for quality, and the agreement
rate with crowdsource workers was 86%. Citation contexts were annotated by 850 crowdsource
workers who made a total of 29,926 annotations
and individually made between 4 and 240 annotations. Each sentence was annotated, on average,
3.74 times. This resulted in a total 9,159 crowdsourced instances which were divided to training
and validation sets with 90% of the data used for
the training set. In addition to the crowdsourced
data, a separate test set of size 1,861 was annotated by a trained, expert annotator to ensure high
quality of the dataset.

3.3. Data for scaffold tasks

For the first scaffold (citation worthiness), we
sample sentences from papers and consider the
sentences with citations as positive labels. We also
remove the citation markers from those sentences

Snttps://github.com/allenai/
science-parse

such as numbered citations (e.g., [1]) or name-year
combinations (e.g, Lee et al (2012)) to not make
the second task artificially easy by only detecting
citation markers. For the second scaffold (citation section title), respective to each test dataset,
we sample citations from the ACL-ARC corpus
and Semantic Scholar corpus’ and extract the citation context as well as their corresponding sections. We manually define regular expression patterns mappings to normalized section titles: “introduction’, “related work’, “method”, “experiments’, “conclusion”. Section titles which did not
map to any of the aforementioned titles were excluded from the dataset. Overall, the size of the
data for scaffold tasks on the ACL-ARC dataset
is about 47K (section title scaffold) and 50K (citation worthiness) while on SciCite is about 91K
and 73K for section title and citation worthiness
scaffolds, respectively.

4 Experiments

4.1 Implementation

We implement our proposed scaffold framework
using the AllenNLP library (Gardner et al., 2018).
For word representations, we use 100-dimensional
GloVe vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) trained on
a corpus of 6B tokens from Wikipedia and Gigaword. For contextual representations, we use
ELMo vectors released by Peters et al. (2018)!°
with output dimension size of 1,024 which have
been trained on a dataset of 5.5B tokens. We
use a single-layer BiLSTM with a hidden dimension size of 50 for each direction!!. For each of
scaffold tasks, we use a single-layer MLP with
20 hidden nodes , ReLU (Nair and Hinton, 2010)
activation and a Dropout rate (Srivastava et al.,
2014) of 0.2 between the hidden and input layers. The hyperparameters A; are tuned for best
performance on the validation set of the respective
datasets using a 0.0 to 0.3 grid search. For example, the following hyperparameters are used for the
ACL-ARC. Citation worthiness saffold: 42=0.08,
A3=0, section title scaffold: 43=0.09, A2=0; both
scaffolds: Ag=0.1, A3=0.05. Batch size is 8 for
ACL-ARC dataset and 32 for SciCite dataset (recall that SciCite is larger than ACL-ARC). We

the smaller dataset, our best model takes approximately 30 minutes per epoch to train (training time
without ELMo is significantly faster). It is known
that multiple runs of probabilistic deep learning models can have variance in overall scores
(Reimers and Gurevych, 2017)!3. We control this
by setting random-number generator seeds; the reported overall results are average of multiple runs
with different random seeds. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code, data, and trained
models. '*

4.2 Baselines

We compare our results to several baselines including the model with state-of-the-art performance on the ACL-ARC dataset.

e BiLSTM Attention (with and without ELMo).
This baseline uses a similar architecture to our
proposed neural multitask learning framework,
except that it only optimizes the network for the
main loss regarding the citation intent classification (£;) and does not include the structural
scaffolds. We experiment with two variants of
this model: with and without using the contextualized word vector representations (ELMo) of
Peters et al. (2018). This baseline is useful for
evaluating the effect of adding scaffolds in controlled experiments.

e Jurgens et al. (2018). To make sure our results
are competitive with state-of-the-art results on
this task, we also compare our model to Jurgens et al. (2018) which has the best reported
results on the ACL-ARC dataset. Jurgens et al.
(2018) incorporate a variety of features, ranging
from pattern-based features to topic-modeling
features, to citation graph features. They also
incorporate section titles and relative section position in the paper as features. Our implementation of this model achieves a macro-averaged
Fl score of 0.526 using 10-fold cross-validation,
which is in line with the highest reported results
in Jurgens et al. (2018): 0.53 using leave-oneout cross validation. We were not able to use

since it is impractical to re-train each variant of
our deep learning models thousands of times.
Therefore, we opted for a standard setup of stratified train/validation/test data splits with 85% data
used for training and the rest equally split between validation and test.

4.3 Results

Our main results for the ACL-ARC dataset (Jurgens et al., 2018) is shown in Table 3. We observe
that our scaffold-enhanced models achieve clear
improvements over the state-of-the-art approach
on this task. Starting with the ‘BiLSTM-Attn’
baseline with a macro F1 score of 51.8, adding the
first scaffold task in ‘BiLSTM-Attn + section title
scaffold’ improves the F1 score to 56.9 (A=5.1).
Adding the second scaffold in “BiLSTM-Attn + citation worthiness scaffold’ also results in similar
improvements: 56.3 (A=4.5). When both scaffolds are used simultaneously in “BiLSTM-Attn +
both scaffolds’, the Fl score further improves to
63.1 (A=11.3), suggesting that the two tasks provide complementary signal that is useful for citation intent prediction.

The best result is achieved when we also add
ELMo vectors (Peters et al., 2018) to the input representations in ‘BiLSTM-Attn w/ ELMo + both
scaffolds’, achieving an Fl of 67.9, a major improvement from the previous state-of-the-art results of Jurgens et al. (2018) 54.6 (A=13.3). We
note that the scaffold tasks provide major contributions on top of the ELMo-enabled baseline
(A=13.6), demonstrating the efficacy of using
structural scaffolds for citation intent prediction.
We note that these results were obtained without
using hand-curated features or additional linguistic resources as used in Jurgens et al. (2018). We
also experimented with adding features used in Jurgens et al. (2018) to our best model and not only
we did not see any improvements, but we observed

at least 1.7% decline in performance. This suggests that these additional manual features do not
provide the model with any additional useful signals beyond what the model already learns from
the data.

Table 4 shows the main results on SciCite
dataset, where we see similar patterns. Each scaffold task improves model performance. Adding
both scaffolds results in further improvements.
And the best results are obtained by using ELMo
representation in addition to both scaffolds. Note
that this dataset is more than five times larger
in size than the ACL-ARC, therefore the performance numbers are generally higher and the F1
gains are generally smaller since it is easier for
the models to learn optimal parameters utilizing
the larger annotated data. On this dataset, the
best baseline is the neural baseline with addition
of ELMo contextual vectors achieving an F1 score
of 82.6 followed by Jurgens et al. (2018), which is
expected because neural models generally achieve
higher gains when more training data is available
and because Jurgens et al. (2018) was not designed
with the SciCite dataset in mind.

The breakdown of results by intent on ACLARC and SciCite datasets is respectively shown in
Tables 5 and 6. Generally we observe that results
on categories with more number of instances are
higher. For example on ACL-ARC, the results on
the BACKGROUND category are the highest as this
category is the most common. Conversely, the results on the FUTUREWORK category are the lowest. This category has the fewest data points (see
distribution of the categories in Table 2) and thus
it is harder for the model to learn the optimal parameters for correct classification in this category.

4.4 Analysis

To gain more insight into why the scaffolds are
helping the model in improved citation intent classification, we examine the attention weights assigned to inputs for our best proposed model

(‘BiLSTM-Attn w/ ELMo + both scaffolds’) compared with the best neural baseline (‘BiLSTMAttn w/ ELMO’). We conduct this analysis for
examples from both datasets. Figure 3 shows an
example input citation along with the horizontal
line and the heatmap of attention weights for this
input resulting from our model versus the baseline. For first example (3a) the true label is FUTUREWORK. We observe that our model puts
more weight on words surrounding the word “‘future” which is plausible given the true label. On
the other hand, the baseline model attends most
to the words “compare” and consequently incorrectly predicts a COMPARE label. In second example (3b) the true label is RESULTCOMPARISON.
The baseline incorrectly classifies it as a BACKGROUND, likely due to attending to another part
of the sentence (“analyzed seprately’’). Our model
correctly classifies this instance by putting more
attention weights on words that relate to comparison of the results. This suggests that the our model
is more successful in learning optimal parameters
for representing the citation text and classifying its
respective intent compared with the baseline. Note
that the only difference between our model and the
neural baseline is inclusion of the structural scaffolds. Therefore, suggesting the effectiveness the
scaffolds in informing the main task of relevant
signals for citation intent classification.

Error analysis. We next investigate errors made
by our best model (Figure 4 plots classification errors). One general error pattern is that the model
has more tendency to make false positive errors
in the BACKGROUND category likely due to this
category dominating both datasets. It’s interesting that for the ACL-ARC dataset some prediction

Example True Prediction

Our work is inspired by the latent left-linking model in © MOTIVATION

(CITATION) and the ILP formulation from (CITATION).

The advantage of tuning similarity to the application of COMPARE BACKGROUND

interest has been shown previously by (CITATION).

One possible direction is to consider linguistically mo- FUTUREWORK BACKGROUND
tivated approaches , such as the extraction of syntactic
phrase tables as proposed by (CITATION).

After the extraction, pruning techniques (CITATION) can BACKGROUND
be applied to increase the precision of the extraction.

Table 7: A sample of model’s classification errors on
ACL-ARC dataset

errors are due to the model failing to properly differentiate the USE category with BACKGROUND.
We found out that some of these errors would have
been possibly prevented by using additional context. Table 7 shows a sample of such classification errors. For the citation in the first row of the
table, the model is likely distracted by “model in
(citation) and “ILP formulation from (citation)”
deeming the sentence is referring to the use of another method from a cited paper and it misses the
first part of the sentence describing the motivation.
This is likely due to the small number of training
instances in the MOTIVATION category, preventing the model to learn such nuances. For the examples in the second and third row, it is not clear if it
is possible to make the correct prediction without
additional context. And similarly in the last row

the instance seems ambiguous without accessing
to additional context. Similarly as shown in Figure 4a two of FUTUREWORK labels are wrongly
classified. One of them is illustrated in the forth
row of Table 7 where perhaps additional context
could have helped the model in identifying the correct label. One possible way to prevent this type of
errors, is to provide the model with an additional
input, modeling the extended surrounding context.
We experimented with encoding the extended surrounding context using a BiLSTM and concatenating it with the main citation context vector (z), but
it resulted in a large decline in overall performance
likely due to the overall noise introduced by the
additional context. A possible future work is to
investigate alternative effective approaches for incorporating the surrounding extended context.

5 Related Work

There is a large body of work studying the intent
of citations and devising categorization systems
(Stevens and Giuliano, 1965; Moravecsik and Murugesan, 1975; Garzone and Mercer, 2000; White,
2004; Ahmed et al., 2004; Teufel et al., 2006;
Agarwal et al., 2010; Dong and Schafer, 2011).
Most of these efforts provide citation categories
that are too fine-grained, some of which rarely occur in papers. Therefore, they are hardly useful
for automated analysis of scientific publications.
To address these problems and to unify previous

efforts, in a recent work, Jurgens et al. (2018)
proposed a six category system for citation intents. In this work, we focus on two schemes: (1)
the scheme proposed by Jurgens et al. (2018) and
(2) an additional, more coarse-grained generalpurpose category system that we propose (details
in $3). Unlike other schemes that are domainspecific, our scheme is general and naturally fits
in scientific discourse in multiple domains.

Early works in automated citation intent classification were based on rule-based systems (e.g.,
(Garzone and Mercer, 2000; Pham and Hoffmann,
2003)). Later, machine learning methods based
on linguistic patterns and other hand-engineered
features from citation context were found to be
effective. For example, Teufel et al. (2006) proposed use of “cue phrases”, a set of expressions
that talk about the act of presenting research in a
paper. Abu-Jbara et al. (2013) relied on lexical,
structural, and syntactic features and a linear SVM
for classification. Researchers have also investigated methods of finding cited spans in the cited
papers. Examples include feature-based methods
(Cohan et al., 2015), domain-specific knowledge
(Cohan and Goharian, 2017), and a recent CNNbased model for joint prediction of cited spans and
citation function (Su et al., 2018). We also experimented with CNNs but found the attention BiLSTM model to work significantly better. Jurgens
et al. (2018) expanded all pre-existing featurebased efforts on citation intent classification by
proposing a comprehensive set of engineered features, including boostrapped patterns, topic modeling, dependency-based, and metadata features
for the task. We argue that we can capture necessary information from the citation context using
a data driven method, without the need for handengineered domain-dependent features or external
resources. We propose a novel scaffold neural

model for citation intent classification to incorporate structural information of scientific discourse
into citations, borrowing the “scaffold” terminology from Swayamdipta et al. (2018) who use auxiliary syntactic tasks for semantic problems.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this work, we show that structural properties
related to scientific discourse can be effectively
used to inform citation intent classification. We
propose a multitask learning framework with two
auxiliary tasks (predicting section titles and citation worthiness) as two scaffolds related to the
main task of citation intent prediction. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art result (Fl score of 67.9%)
on the ACL-ARC dataset with 13.3 absolute increase over the best previous results. We additionally introduce SciCite, a new large dataset of citation intents and also show the effectiveness of our
model on this dataset. Our dataset, unlike existing datasets that are designed based on a specific
domain, is more general and fits in scientific discourse from multiple scientific domains.

We demonstrate that carefully chosen auxiliary
tasks that are inherently relevant to a main task
can be leveraged to improve the performance on
the main task. An interesting line of future work
is to explore the design of such tasks or explore
the properties or similarities between the auxiliary
and the main tasks. Another relevant line of work
is adapting our model to other domains containing
documents with similar linked structured such as
Wikipedia articles. Future work may benefit from
replacing ELMo with other types of contextualized representations such as BERT in our scaffold
model. For example, at the time of finalizing the
camera ready version of this paper, Beltagy et al.
(2019) showed that a BERT contextualized representation model (Devlin et al., 2018) trained on
scientific text can achieve promising results on the
SciCite dataset.
