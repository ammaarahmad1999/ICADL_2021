Abstract

We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional
convolutional neural network that is composed of
two parts, one to encode the source sequence and
the other to decode the target sequence. The two
network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the
temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the
target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by
which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over
the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet
uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network
has two core properties: it runs in time that
is linear in the length of the sequences and it
sidesteps the need for excessive memorization.
The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling
and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
character-to-character machine translation on the
English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models
that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We
find that the latent alignment structure contained
in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.

1. Introduction

In neural language modelling, a neural network estimates
a distribution over sequences of words or characters that
belong to a given language (Bengio et al., 2003). In neural machine translation, the network estimates a distribution over sequences in the target language conditioned on
a given sequence in the source language. The network can
be thought of as composed of two parts: a source network
(the encoder) that encodes the source sequence into a representation and a target network (the decoder) that uses the

representation of the source encoder to generate the target
sequence (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013).

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are powerful sequence
models (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and are widely
used in language modelling (Mikolov et al., 2010), yet they
have a potential drawback. RNNs have an inherently serial structure that prevents them from being run in parallel
along the sequence length during training and evaluation.
Forward and backward signals in a RNN also need to traverse the full distance of the serial path to reach from one
token in the sequence to another. The larger the distance,
the harder it is to learn the dependencies between the tokens
(Hochreiter et al., 2001).

A number of neural architectures have been proposed
for modelling translation, such as encoder-decoder networks (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al.,
2014; Cho et al., 2014; Kaiser & Bengio, 2016), networks
with attentional pooling (Bahdanau et al., 2014) and twodimensional networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016a). Despite the generally good performance, the proposed models

either have running time that is super-linear in the length of
the source and target sequences, or they process the source
sequence into a constant size representation, burdening the
model with a memorization step. Both of these drawbacks
grow more severe as the length of the sequences increases.

We present a family of encoder-decoder neural networks
that are characterized by two architectural mechanisms
aimed to address the drawbacks of the conventional approaches mentioned above. The first mechanism involves
the stacking of the decoder on top of the representation of
the encoder in a manner that preserves the temporal resolution of the sequences; this is in contrast with architectures that encode the source into a fixed-size representation
(Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014).
The second mechanism is the dynamic unfolding mechanism that allows the network to process in a simple and efficient way source and target sequences of different lengths
(Sect. 3.2).

The ByteNet is the instance within this family of models
that uses one-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(CNN) of fixed depth for both the encoder and the decoder
(Fig. 1). The two CNNs use increasing factors of dilation to
rapidly grow the receptive fields; a similar technique is also
used in (van den Oord et al., 2016a). The convolutions in
the decoder CNN are masked to prevent the network from
seeing future tokens in the target sequence (van den Oord
et al., 2016b).

The network has beneficial computational and learning
properties. From a computational perspective, the network
has a running time that is /inear in the length of the source
and target sequences (up to a constant c & logd where
d is the size of the desired dependency field). The computation in the encoder during training and decoding and
in the decoder during training can also be run efficiently
in parallel along the sequences (Sect. 2). From a learning perspective, the representation of the source sequence
in the ByteNet is resolution preserving; the representation
sidesteps the need for memorization and allows for maximal bandwidth between encoder and decoder. In addition,
the distance traversed by forward and backward signals between any input and output tokens corresponds to the fixed
depth of the networks and is largely independent of the dis
tance between the tokens. Dependencies over large distances are connected by short paths and can be learnt more
easily.

We apply the ByteNet model to strings of characters
for character-level language modelling and character-tocharacter machine translation. We evaluate the decoder
network on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia task (Hutter,
2012) where it achieves the state-of-the-art performance
of 1.31 bits/character. We further evaluate the encoderdecoder network on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT benchmark where
it achieves a state-of-the-art BLEU score of 22.85 (0.380
bits/character) and 25.53 (0.389 bits/character) on the 2014
and 2015 test sets, respectively. On the character-level machine translation task, ByteNet betters a comparable version of GNMT (Wu et al., 2016a) that is a state-of-the-art
system. These results show that deep CNNs are simple,
scalable and effective architectures for challenging linguistic processing tasks.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the
background and some desiderata for neural architectures
underlying translation models. Section 3 defines the proposed family of architectures and the specific convolutional
instance (ByteNet) used in the experiments. Section 4 analyses ByteNet as well as existing neural translation models
based on the desiderata set out in Section 2. Section 5 reports the experiments on language modelling and Section 6
reports the experiments on character-to-character machine
translation.

2. Neural Translation Model

Given a string s from a source language, a neural translation model estimates a distribution p(t|s) over strings t of
a target language. The distribution indicates the probability
of a string t being a translation of s. A product of conditionals over the tokens in the target t = to,...,t~ leads to
a tractable formulation of the distribution:

N

p(t|s) = | | p(tilt<i,s) (1)

~=0
Neural Machine Translation in Linear Time

Each conditional factor expresses complex and long-range
dependencies among the source and target tokens. The
strings are usually sentences of the respective languages;
the tokens are words or, as in the our case, characters.
The network that models p(t|s) is composed of two parts:
a source network (the encoder) that processes the source
string into a representation and a target network (the decoder) that uses the source representation to generate the
target string (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013). The decoder functions as a language model for the target lan
guage.

A neural translation model has some basic properties. The
decoder is autoregressive in the target tokens and the model
is sensitive to the ordering of the tokens in the source and
target strings. It is also useful for the model to be able
to assign a non-zero probability to any string in the target
language and retain an open vocabulary.

2.1. Desiderata

Beyond these basic properties the definition of a neural
translation model does not determine a unique neural architecture, so we aim at identifying some desiderata.

First, the running time of the network should be linear in
the length of the source and target strings. This ensures
that the model is scalable to longer strings, which is the
case when using characters as tokens.

The use of operations that run in parallel along the sequence length can also be beneficial for reducing computation time.

Second, the size of the source representation should be linear in the length of the source string, i.e. it should be resolution preserving, and not have constant size. This is to
avoid burdening the model with an additional memorization step before translation. In more general terms, the size
of a representation should be proportional to the amount of
information it represents or predicts.

Third, the path traversed by forward and backward signals
in the network (between input and ouput tokens) should be
short. Shorter paths whose length is largely decoupled from
the sequence distance between the two tokens have the potential to better propagate the signals (Hochreiter et al.,
2001) and to let the network learn long-range dependencies
more easily.

3. ByteNet

We aim at building neural language and translation models that capture the desiderata set out in Sect. 2.1. The
proposed ByteNet architecture is composed of a decoder that is stacked on an encoder (Sect. 3.1) and
generates variable-length outputs via dynamic unfolding

(Sect. 3.2). The decoder is a language model that is formed
of one-dimensional convolutional layers that are masked
(Sect. 3.4) and use dilation (Sect. 3.5). The encoder processes the source string into a representation and is formed
of one-dimensional convolutional layers that use dilation
but are not masked. Figure | depicts the two networks and
their combination.

3.1. Encoder-Decoder Stacking

A notable feature of the proposed family of architectures
is the way the encoder and the decoder are connected. To
maximize the representational bandwidth between the encoder and the decoder, we place the decoder on top of
the representation computed by the encoder. This is in
contrast to models that compress the source representation
into a fixed-size vector (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013;
Sutskever et al., 2014) or that pool over the source representation with a mechanism such as attentional pooling
(Bahdanau et al., 2014).

3.2. Dynamic Unfolding

An encoder and a decoder network that process sequences
of different lengths cannot be directly connected due to the
different sizes of the computed representations. We circumvent this issue via a mechanism which we call dynamic
unfolding, which works as follows.

Given source and target sequences s and t with respective
lengths |s| and |t|, one first chooses a sufficiently tight up
 

per bound |t| on the target length |t| as a linear function of
the source length |s|:

network.

The tight upper bound It is chosen in such a way that, on
the one hand, it is greater than the actual length |t| in almost
all cases and, on the other hand, it does not increase excessively the amount of computation that is required. Once
a linear relationship is chosen, one designs the source encoder s|, the
encoder outputs a representation of the established length

                                    

It]. In our case, we let a = 1.20 and b = 0 when translating
from English into German, as German sentences tend to be
somewhat longer than their English counterparts (Fig. 5).
In this manner the representation produced by the encoder
can be efficiently computed, while maintaining high bandwidth and being resolution-preserving. Once the encoder
representation is computed, we let the decoder unfold stepby-step over the encoder representation until the decoder itself outputs an end-of-sequence symbol; the unfolding process may freely proceed beyond the estimated length It of
the encoder representation. Figure 2 gives an example of
dynamic unfolding.

3.3. Input Embedding Tensor

Given the target sequence t = fo,...,t, the ByteNet decoder embeds each of the first n tokens to,...,t,—1 via a
look-up table (the n tokens ¢1, ...,t, serve as targets for the
predictions). The resulting embeddings are concatenated
into a tensor of size n x 2d where d is the number of inner
channels in the network.

3.4. Masked One-dimensional Convolutions

The decoder applies masked one-dimensional convolutions
(van den Oord et al., 2016b) to the input embedding tensor that have a masked kernel of size k. The masking ensures that information from future tokens does not affect
the prediction of the current token. The operation can be
implemented either by zeroing out some of the weights of
a wider kernel of size 2k — 1 or by padding the input map.

coefficient for the English-to-German WMT NewsTest-2013 validation data. The correlation coefficient is similarly high (9 >
0.96) for all other language pairs that we inspected.

3.5. Dilation

The masked convolutions use dilation to increase the receptive field of the target network (Chen et al., 2014; Yu
& Koltun, 2015). Dilation makes the receptive field grow
exponentially in terms of the depth of the networks, as opposed to linearly. We use a dilation scheme whereby the dilation rates are doubled every layer up to a maximum rate r
(for our experiments r = 16). The scheme is repeated multiple times in the network always starting from a dilation
rate of 1 (van den Oord et al., 2016a; Kalchbrenner et al.,
2016b).

3.6. Residual Blocks

Each layer is wrapped in a residual block that contains
additional convolutional layers with filters of size 1 x 1
(He et al., 2016). We adopt two variants of the residual
blocks: one with ReLUs, which is used in the machine
translation experiments, and one with Multiplicative Units
(Kalchbrenner et al., 2016b), which is used in the language
modelling experiments. Figure 3 diagrams the two variants of the blocks. In both cases, we use layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) before the activation function, as
it is well suited to sequence processing where computing
the activation statistics over the following future tokens (as
would be done by batch normalization) must be avoided.
After a series of residual blocks of increased dilation, the
network applies one more convolution and ReLU followed
by a convolution and a final softmax layer.

4. Model Comparison

In this section we analyze the properties of various previously introduced neural translation models as well as the
ByteNet family of models. For the sake of a more complete analysis, we include two recurrent ByteNet variants
(which we do not evaluate in the experiments).

4.1. Recurrent ByteNets

The ByteNet is composed of two stacked encoder and decoder networks where the decoder network dynamically
adapts to the output length. This way of combining the
networks is not tied to the networks being strictly convolutional. We may consider two variants of the ByteNet that
use recurrent networks for one or both of the networks (see
Figure 4). The first variant replaces the convolutional decoder with a recurrent one that is similarly stacked and dynamically unfolded. The second variant also replaces the
convolutional encoder with a recurrent encoder, e.g. a bidirectional RNN. The target RNN is then placed on top of the
source RNN. Considering the latter Recurrent ByteNet, we
can see that the RNN Enc-Dec network (Sutskever et al.,
2014; Cho et al., 2014) is a Recurrent ByteNet where all
connections between source and target — except for the first
one that connects so and to — have been severed. The Recurrent ByteNet is a generalization of the RNN Enc-Dec
and, modulo the type of weight-sharing scheme, so is the
convolutional ByteNet.

4.2. Comparison of Properties

In our comparison we consider the following neural
translation models: the Recurrent Continuous Translation
Model (RCTM) | and 2 (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013);
the RNN Enc-Dec (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014);
the RNN Enc-Dec Att with the attentional pooling mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) of which there are a few variations (Luong et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2016a); the Grid
LSTM translation model (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016a) that
uses a multi-dimensional architecture; the Extended Neural
GPU model (Kaiser & Bengio, 2016) that has a convolutional RNN architecture; the ByteNet and the two Recurrent ByteNet variants.

Our comparison criteria reflect the desiderata set out in
Sect. 2.1. We separate the first (computation time) desider
atum into three columns. The first column indicates the
time complexity of the network as a function of the length
of the sequences and is denoted by Time. The other two
columns Nets and Netr indicate, respectively, whether the
source and the target network use a convolutional structure (CNN) or a recurrent one (RNN); a CNN structure
has the advantage that it can be run in parallel along the
length of the sequence. The second (resolution preservation) desideratum corresponds to the RP column, which
indicates whether the source representation in the network
is resolution preserving. Finally, the third desideratum
(short forward and backward flow paths) is reflected by two
columns. The Paths column corresponds to the length in
layer steps of the shortest path between a source token and
any output target token. Similarly, the Path; column corresponds to the length of the shortest path between an input
target token and any output target token. Shorter paths lead
to better forward and backward signal propagation.

Table 1 summarizes the properties of the models. The
ByteNet, the Recurrent ByteNets and the RNN Enc-Dec
are the only networks that have linear running time (up
to the constant c). The RNN Enc-Dec, however, does not
preserve the source sequence resolution, a feature that aggravates learning for long sequences such as those that appear in character-to-character machine translation (Luong
& Manning, 2016). The RCTM 2, the RNN Enc-Dec Att,
the Grid LSTM and the Extended Neural GPU do preserve
the resolution, but at a cost of a quadratic running time. The
ByteNet stands out also for its Path properties. The dilated
structure of the convolutions connects any two source or
target tokens in the sequences by way of a small number
of network layers corresponding to the depth of the source
or target networks. For character sequences where learning
long-range dependencies is important, paths that are sublinear in the distance are advantageous.

Prize Wikipedia benchmark.

5. Character Prediction

We first evaluate the ByteNet Decoder separately on a
character-level language modelling benchmark. We use the
Hutter Prize version of the Wikipedia dataset and follow the
standard split where the first 90 million bytes are used for
training, the next 5 million bytes are used for validation and
the last 5 million bytes are used for testing (Chung et al.,
2015). The total number of characters in the vocabulary is
205.

The ByteNet Decoder that we use for the result has 30
residual blocks split into six sets of five blocks each; for
the five blocks in each set the dilation rates are, respectively, 1, 2,4, 8 and 16. The masked kernel has size 3. This
gives a receptive field of 315 characters. The number of
hidden units d is 512. For this task we use residual multiplicative blocks (Fig. 3 Right). For the optimization we use
Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.0003
and a weight decay term of 0.0001. We apply dropout to
the last ReLU layer before the softmax dropping units with
a probability of 0.1. We do not reduce the learning rate during training. At each step we sample a batch of sequences
of 500 characters each, use the first 100 characters as the
minimum context and predict the latter 400 characters.

Table 3 lists recent results of various neural sequence
models on the Wikipedia dataset. All the results except for the ByteNet result are obtained using some variant of the LSTM recurrent neural network (Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber, 1997). The ByteNet decoder achieves 1.31
bits/character on the test set.

6. Character-Level Machine Translation

We evaluate the full ByteNet on the WMT English to German translation task. We use NewsTest 2013 for validation
and NewsTest 2014 and 2015 for testing. The English and
German strings are encoded as sequences of characters; no
explicit segmentation into words or morphemes is applied
to the strings. The outputs of the network are strings of
characters in the target language. We keep 323 characters
in the German vocabulary and 296 in the English vocabulary.

The ByteNet used in the experiments has 30 residual blocks
in the encoder and 30 residual blocks in the decoder. As
in the ByteNet Decoder, the residual blocks are arranged
in sets of five with corresponding dilation rates of 1,2, 4,8
and 16. For this task we use the residual blocks with ReLUs
(Fig. 3 Left). The number of hidden units d is 800. The
size of the kernel in the source network is 3, whereas the
size of the masked kernel in the target network is 3. For the
optimization we use Adam with a learning rate of 0.0003.

plied to each source sentence as a part of dynamic unfolding (eq. 2). Each pair of sentences is mapped to a bucket
based on the pair of padded lengths for efficient batching
during training. We use vanilla beam search according to
the total likelihood of the generated candidate and accept
only candidates which end in a end-of-sentence token. We
use a beam of size 12. We do not use length normalization,
nor do we keep score of which parts of the source sentence
have been translated (Wu et al., 2016a).

Table 2 and Table 4 contain the results of the experiments.
On NewsTest 2014 the ByteNet achieves the highest performance in character-level and subword-level neural machine
translation, and compared to the word-level systems it is
second only to the version of GNMT that uses word-pieces.
On NewsTest 2015, to our knowledge, ByteNet achieves
the best published results to date.

Table 5 contains some of the unaltered generated translations from the ByteNet that highlight reordering and other
phenomena such as transliteration. The character-level
aspect of the model makes post-processing unnecessary
in principle. We further visualize the sensitivity of the
ByteNet’s predictions to specific source and target inputs
using gradient-based visualization (Simonyan et al., 2013).
Figure 6 represents a heatmap of the magnitude of the gradients of the generated outputs with respect to the source
and target inputs. For visual clarity, we sum the gradients
for all the characters that make up each word and normalize the values along each column. In contrast with the attentional pooling mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014), this
general technique allows us to inspect not just dependencies of the outputs on the source inputs, but also dependencies of the outputs on previous target inputs, or on any other
neural network layers.

7. Conclusion

We have introduced the ByteNet, a neural translation model
that has linear running time, decouples translation from
memorization and has short signal propagation paths for
tokens in sequences. We have shown that the ByteNet decoder is a state-of-the-art character-level language model
based on a convolutional neural network that outperforms
recurrent neural language models. We have also shown that
the ByteNet generalizes the RNN Enc-Dec architecture and
achieves state-of-the-art results for character-to-character
machine translation and excellent results in general, while
maintaining linear running time complexity. We have revealed the latent structure learnt by the ByteNet and found
it to mirror the expected alignment between the tokens in
the sentences.

Figure 6. Magnitude of gradients of the predicted outputs with respect to the source and target inputs. The gradients are summed
for all the characters in a given word. In the bottom heatmap the
magnitudes are nonzero on the diagonal, since the prediction of a
target character depends highly on the preceding target character
in the same word.
