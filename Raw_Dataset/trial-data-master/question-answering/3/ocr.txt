Abstract

Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts of two input sentences, and simply ignore the dissimilar parts, which usually give us some clues and semantic
meanings about the sentences. In this work, we propose a model to take into account both the
similarities and dissimilarities by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences.
The model represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each
word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching vector. After this,
a two-channel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors.
Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer
sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.

1 Introduction

Sentence similarity is a fundamental metric to measure the degree of likelihood between a pair of sentences. It plays an important role for a variety of tasks in both NLP and IR communities. For example, in
paraphrase identification task, sentence similarity is used to determine whether two sentences are para
phrases or not (Yin and Schititze, 2015})He et al., 2015). For question answering and information retrieval

tasks, sentence similarities between query-answer pairs are used for assessing the relevance and ranking

all the candidate answers (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015}|Wang and Ittycheriah, 2015).

However, sentence similarity learning has following challenges:

1. There is a lexical gap between semantically equivalent sentences. Take the E; and FE» in Table [1]
for example, they have the similar meaning but with different lexicons.

2. Semantic similarity should be measured at different levels of granularity (word-level, phrase-level
and syntax-level). E.g., “not related” in E is an indivisible phrase when matching with “irrelevant”
in E, (shown in square brackets).

3. The dissimilarity (shown in angle brackets) between two sentences is also a significant clue
al., 2006). For example, by judging the dissimilar parts, we can easily identify that /3 and Es share
the similar meaning “The study is about salmon’, because “sockeye” belongs to the salmon family,
and “flounder” does not. Whereas the meaning of F4 is quite different from £3, which emphasizes
“The study is about red (a special kind of) salmon’, because both “sockeye” and “coho” are in the
salmon family. How we can extract and utilize those information becomes another challenge.

In order to handle the above challenges, researchers have been working on sentence similarity algorithms for a long time. To bridge the lexical gap (challenge 1), some word similarity metrics were
proposed to match different but semantically related words. Examples include knowledge-based metrics and corpus-based metrics
al., 2015). To measure sentence similarity from various granularities (challenge 2), researchers have explored features extracted from n-grams, continuous phrases, discontinuous phrases, and parse trees

and Schutze, 2015} |He et al., 2015} |Heilman and Smith, 2010). The third challenge did not get much
FE, The research is [irrelevant] to sockeye.
2 The study is [not related] to salmon.

E3 The research is relevant to salmon.
E4 The study is relevant to sockeye, (instead of coho).
Es The study is relevant to sockeye, (rather than flounder).

attention in the past, the only related work of |Qiu et al. (2006) explored the dissimilarity between sentences in a pair for paraphrase identification task, but they require human annotations in order to train a

classifier, and their performance is still below the state of the art.

In this paper, we propose a novel model to tackle all these challenges jointly by decomposing and
composing lexical semantics over sentences. Given a sentence pair, the model represents each word as
a low-dimensional vector (challenge 1), and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based
on all words in the other sentence (challenge 2). Then based on the semantic matching vector, each word
vector is decomposed into two components: a similar component and a dissimilar component (challenge
3). We use similar components of all the words to represent the similar parts of the sentence pair, and dissimilar components of every word to model the dissimilar parts explicitly. After this, a two-channel CNN
operation is performed to compose the similar and dissimilar components into a feature vector (challenge
2 and 3). Finally, the composed feature vector is utilized to predict the sentence similarity. Experimental
results on two tasks show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence
selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.

In following parts, we start with a brief overview of our model (Section 2), followed by the details of
our end-to-end implementation (Section (3). Then we evaluate our model on answer sentence selection
and paraphrase identifications tasks (Section |4p.

2 Model Overview

In this section, we propose a sentence similarity learning model to tackle all three challenges (mentioned
in Section 1). To deal with the first challenge, we represent each word as a distributed vector, so that
we can calculate similarities for formally different but semantically related words. To tackle the second
challenge, we assume that each word can be semantically matched by several words in the other sentence,
and we calculate a semantic matching vector for each word vector based on all the word vectors in the
other side. To cope with the third challenge, we assume that each semantic unit (word) can be partially
matched, and can be decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on its
semantic matching vector.

Figure[1|shows an overview of our sentence similarity model. Given a pair of sentences S and 7’, our
task is to calculate a similarity score sim(S, 7) in following steps:

Word Representation. Word embedding of |Mikolov et al. (2013) is an effective way to handle the

lexical gap challenge in the sentence similarity task, as it represents each word with a distributed vector,
and words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Mikolov et al., 2013). With
those pre-trained embeddings, we transform S and T into sentence matrixes S = [51,..., $;,..., Sm] and
T = ({t1,...,t;,...,tn], where s; and t; are d-dimension vectors of the corresponding words, and m and
n are sentence length of S and T' respectively.

Semantic Matching. In order to judge the similarity between two sentences, we need to check whether
each semantic unit in one sentence is covered by the other sentence, or vice versa. For example, in
Table|1| to check whether F is a paraphrase of £1, we need to know the single word “irrelevant” in Fy
is matched or covered by the phrase “not related” in /2. In our model, we treat each word as a primitive
semantic unit, and calculate a semantic matching vector s; for each word s; by composing part or full
word vectors in the other sentence 7’. In this way, we can match a word s; to a word or phrase in T’.

Similarly, for the reverse direction, we also calculate all semantic matching vectors t; inT.

We explore different fmatcn functions later in Section [3]

Decomposition. After the semantic matching phase, we have the semantic matching vectors of s; and
tj. We interpret s; (or t;) as a semantic coverage of word s; (or t;) by the sentence 7’ (or S). However,
it is not necessary that all the semantics of s; (or t;) are fully covered by §; (or tj). Take the £; and 2
in Table [1] for example, the word “sockeye” in F is only partially matched by the word “salmon” (the
similar part) in 2, as the full meaning of “sockeye” is “red salmon” (the semantic meaning of “red”
is the dissimilar part). Motivated by this phenomenon, our model further decomposes word s; (or t;),
based on its semantic matching vector §; (or ti), into two components: similar component si (or tr) and

dissimilar component s; (or ¢; ). Formally, we define the decomposition function as:

[s; S; | — Saecomp' Si. Si) Ys, ES (2)

tr; te | — faecomp(t;, t;) Vt ef
Composition. Given a similar component matrix St = [sy] ,..., 85] (or T* = [t7,...,t]) and a
dissimilar component matrix S~ = |s],...,5,,|] (or I~ = [t7,...,t,]), our goal in this step is how

to utilize those information. Besides the suggestion from |Qiu et al. (2006) that the significance of the
dissimilar parts alone between two sentences has a great effect of their similarity, we also think that the

dissimilar and similar components have strong connections. For example, in Table[I| if we only look at
the dissimilar or similar part alone, it is hard to judge which one between Fy and Fs is more similar to E3.
We can easily identify that Es is more similar to £3, when we consider both the similar and dissimilar
parts. Therefore, our model composes the similar component matrix and dissimilar component matrix
into a feature vector S (or T’) with the composition function:

5= feomp(S*, S™ ) (3)
T — feomp(T™, T)
Similarity assessing. In the final stage, we concatenate the two feature vectors (S$ and T’) and predict

the final similarity score:
sim(S,T) = fsim(S,T) (4)

3 An End-to-End Implementation
Section |2| gives us a glance of our model. In this section, we describe details of each phase.

3.1 Semantic Matching Functions

This subsection describes our specifications for the semantic matching function fmaten in Eq. (ip. The
goal of fmatch 1S to generate a semantic matching vector s; for s; by composing the vectors from 7’.

For a sentence pair S and T’, we first calculate a similarity matrix A;,.,, where each element a;,; €

where k = argmax, a;,;. The idea of the global function is to consider all word vectors t; in T’. A
semantic matching vector s; is a weighted sum vector of all words t; in 7’, where each weight is the
normalized word similarity a;,;. The max function moves to the other extreme. It generates the semantic
matching vector by selecting the most similar word vector t; from 7’. The /ocal-w function takes a
compromise between global and max, where w indicates the size of the window to consider centered at

k; (the most similar word position). So the semantic matching vector is a weighted average vector from
th—w to tk w
3.2 Decomposition Functions

This subsection describes the implementations for the decomposition function fgecomp in Eq. (2). The
intention of fdecomp 18 to decompose a word vector s; based on its semantic matching vector s; into a
similar component st and a dissimilar component s, , where sf indicates the semantics of s; covered
by s; and s, indicates the uncovered part. We implement three types of decomposition function: rigid,
linear and orthogonal.

The rigid decomposition only adapts to the max version of finatcn. First, it detects whether there is
an exactly matched word in the other sentence, or s; equal to s;. If yes, the vector s; 1s dispatched to
the similar component s,, and the dissimilar component is assigned with a zero vector 0. Otherwise, the

vector s; 1s assigned to the dissimilar component s, . Eq. (7) gives the formal definition:

, = 0) if 8; = $; (7)
= 3; otherwise

The motivation for the linear decomposition is that the more similar between s; and §;, the higher
proportion of s; should be assigned to the similar component. First, we calculate the cosine similarity
a between s; and s;. Then, we decompose s; linearly based on a. Eq. gives the corresponding
definition:
st §;
sill - [sil

: (8)

5, = as;

a

s, =(l-a)s;

The orthogonal decomposition is to decompose a vector in the geometric space. Based on the semantic
matching vector s;, our model decomposes s; into a parallel component and a perpendicular component.
Then, the parallel component is viewed as the similar component 8; , and perpendicular component is
taken as the dissimilar component s, . Eq. (9) gives the concrete definitions.

Si° Si.
si — ——§, parallel
§;° 8 (9)
perpendicular

 

3.3. Composition Functions

The aim of composition function feomp in Eq. is to extract features from both the similar component
matrix and the dissimilar component matrix. We also want to acquire similarities and dissimilarities of
various granularity during the composition phase. Inspired from|{Kim (2014), we utilize a two-channel
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and design filters based on various order of n-grams, e.g., unigram,
bigram and trigram.

The CNN model involves two sequential operations: convolution and max-pooling. For the convolution operation, we define a list of filters {w,}. The shape of each filter is d x h, where d is the dimension
of word vectors and h is the window size. Each filter is applied to two patches (a window size h of
vectors) from both similar and dissimilar channels, and generates a feature. Eq. expresses this
process.

Cod = f(Wo * Shiny + Wo * Si i ny + Bo) (10)

where the operation A * B sums up all elements in B with the corresponding weights in A, S*.

[i:t-+h]
and Si. ith indicate the patches from S* and S~, b, is a bias term and f is a non-linear function (we
use tanh in this work). We apply this filter to all possible patches, and produce a series of features
Co = [Co,1; Co,2; +++ Co,0]. The number of features in c, depends on the shape of the filter wo and the
length of the input sentence. To deal with variable feature size, we perform a max-pooling operation
over Co by selecting the maximum value cy = maz co. Therefore, after these two operations, each filter
generates only one feature. We define several filters by varying the window size and the initial values.
Eventually, a vector of features is captured by composing the two component matrixes, and the feature
dimension is equal to the number of filters.

3.4 Similarity Assessment Function

The similarity assessment function fs in Eq. predicts a similarity score by taking two feature
vectors as input. We employ a linear function to sum up all the features and apply a sigmoid function to
constrain the similarity within the range [0, 1].

3.5 Training

We train our sentence similariy model by maximizing the likelihood on a training set. Each training
instance in the training set is represented as a triple (S;, 7;, L;), where S; and 7; are a pair of sentences,
and L; € {0,1} indicates the similarity between them. We assign L; = 1 if T; is a paraphrase of S; for
the paraphrase identification task, or 7; is a correct answer for S; for the answer sentence selection task.
Otherwise, we assign L; = 0. We implement the mathematical expressions with Theano
and use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) for optimization.
4 Experiment

4.1 Experimental Setting

We evaluate our model on two tasks: answer sentence selection and paraphrase identification. The answer
sentence selection task is to rank a list of candidate answers based on their similarities to a question
sentence, and the performance is measured by mean average precision (MAP) and mean reciprocal rank
(MRR). We experiment on two datasets: QASent and WikiQA. The statistics of the two datasets can be

found in|Yang et al. (2015), where QASent (Wang et al., 2007) was created from the TREC QA track,

and WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) is constructed from real queries of Bing and Wikipedia. The paraphrase
identification task is to detect whether two sentences are paraphrases based on the similarity between

them. The metrics include the accuracy and the positive class F score. We experiment on the Microsoft
Research Paraphrase corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al., 2004), which includes 2753 true and 1323 false
instances in the training set, and 1147 true and 578 false instances in the test set. We build a development
set by randomly selecting 100 true and 100 false instances from the training set. In all experiments, we
set the size of word vector dimension as d =300, and pre-train the vectors with the word2vec toolkit

(Mikolov et al., 2013) on the English Gigaword (LDC2011T07).
4.2 Model Properties

There are several alternative options in our model, e.g., the semantic matching functions, the decomposition operations, and the filter types. The choice of these options may affect the final performance.
In this subsection, we present some experiments to demonstrate the properties of our model, and find a
good configuration that we use to evaluate our final model. All the experiments in this subsection were
performed on the QASent dataset and evaluated on the development set.

First, we evaluated the effectiveness of various semantic matching functions. We switched the semantic matching functions among {max, global, local-l}, where | € {1, 2, 3, 4}, and fixed the other options
as: the linear decomposition, the filter types including {unigram, bigram, trigram}, and 500 filters for
each type. Figure |2|/(a) presents the results. We found that the max function worked better than the
global function on both MAP and MRR. By increasing the window size, the /ocal-l function acquired
progressive improvements when the window size is smaller than 4. But after we enlarged the window
size to 4, the performance dropped. The /ocal-3 function worked better than the max function in term
of the MAP, and also got a comparable MRR. Therefore, we use the Jocal-3 function in the following
experiments.

Second, we studied the effect of various decomposition operations. We varied the decomposition
operation among { rigid, linear, orthogonal}, and kept the other options unchanged. Figure |2](b) shows
the performance. We found that the rigid operation got the worst result. This is reasonable, because the
rigid operation decomposes word vectors by exactly matching words. The orthogonal operation got a
similar MAP as the /inear operation, and it worked better in term of MRR. Therefore, we choose the
orthogonal operation in the following experiments.

Third, we tested the influence of various filter types. We constructed 5 groups of filters: win-/ contains
only the unigram filters, win-2 contains both unigram and bigram filters, win-3 contains all the filters in
win-2 plus trigram filters, win-4 extends filters in win-3 with 4-gram filters, and win-5 adds 5-gram filters
into win-4. We generate 500 filters for each filter type (with different initial values). Experimental
results are shown in Figure[2](c). At the beginning, adding higher-order ngram filters was helpful for the
performance. The performance reached to the peak, when we used the win-3 filters. After that, adding
more complex filters decreased the performance. Therefore, the trigram is the best granularity for our
model. In the following experiments, we utilize filter types in win-3.

Severyn and Moschitti (2015) employed a CNN model to compose each sentence into a vector separately,

and joined the two sentence vectors to compute the sentence similarity. Because only the sentencelevel granularity was used, the performance is much lower (the second row of Table (2). After adding
some word overlap features between the two sentences, the performance was improved significantly
(the third row of Table (2). Therefore, the lower-level granularity is an indispensable factor for a good
performance. conducted word alignment for a sentence pair based on word
vectors, and measured the sentence similarity based on a couple of word alignment features. They got
a slightly better performance (the fourth row of Table 2). which indicates that the vector representation
for words is helpful to bridging the lexical gap problem. introduced the attention
mechanism into the CNN model, and learnt sentence representation by considering the influence of the
other sentence. They got better performance than all the other previous work. Our model makes use
of all these useful factors and also considers the dissimilarities of a sentence pair. We can see that our
model (the last row of Table[2) got the best MAP among all previous work, and a comparable MRR than

constructed the dataset and reimplemented several baseline models. The best performance
(shown at the second row of Table [3) was acquired by a bigram CNN model combining with the word

introduced the attention mechanism into the CNN model, and captured the best
performance (the fifth row of Table |3). The semantic matching phase in our model is similar to the
attention mechanism. But different from the previous models, our model utilizes both the similarity and
dissimilarity simultaneously. The last row of Table |3} shows that our model is more effective than the
other models.

granularity and modeled interaction features at each level for a pair of sentences. They obtained their best
performance by pretraining the model on a language modeling task (the 3rd row of Table (4). However,
their model heavily depends on the pretraining strategy. Without pretraining, they got a much worse
performance (the second row of Table|/4). proposed a similar model to/Yin and Schiitze|
(2015). Similarly, they also used a CNN model to extract features at multiple levels of granularity.
Differently, they utilized some extra annotated resources, e.g., embeddings from part-of-speech (POS)

tags and PARAGRAM vectors trained from the Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). Their
model outperformed |Yin and Schiitze (2015) without the need of pretraining (the sixth row of Table (4).

However, the performance was reduced after removing the extra resources (the fourth and fifth rows of
Table|4). applied their attention-based CNN model on this dataset. By adding a couple of
sparse features and using a layerwise training strategy, they got a pretty good performance. Comparing to
these neural network based models, our model obtained a comparable performance (the last row of Table
without using any sparse features, extra annotated resources and specific training strategies. However,
the best performance so far on this dataset is obtained by|Ji and Eisenstein (2013). In their model, they
just utilized several hand-crafted features in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Therefore, the
deep learning methods still have a long way to go for this task.

5 Related Work

The semantic matching functions in subsection|3. I]are inspired from the attention-based neural machine
translation ‘Luong et al., 2015). However, most of the previous work using the
attention mechanism in only LSTM models. Whereas our model introduces the attention mechanism
into the CNN model. A similar work is the attention-based CNN model proposed by [Yin et al. (2015).
They first build an attention matrix for a sentence pair, and then directly take the attention matrix as a
new channel of the CNN model. Differently, our model uses the attention matrix (or similarity matrix)
to decompose the original sentence matrix into a similar component matrix and a dissimilar component
matrix, and then feeds these two matrixes into a two-channel CNN model. The model can then focus
much on the interactions between similar and dissimilar parts of a sentence pair.

6 Conclusion

In this work, we proposed a model to assess sentence similarity by decomposing and composing lexical
semantics. To bridge the lexical gap problem, our model represents each word with its context vector.
To extract features from both the similarity and dissimilarity of a sentence pair, we designed several
methods to decompose the word vector into a similar component and a dissimilar component. To extract
features at multiple levels of granularity, we employed a two-channel CNN model and equipped it with
multiple types of ngram filters. Experimental results show that our model is quite effective on both the
answer sentence selection task and the paraphrase identification task .
