(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||introduce||meta network)
(meta network||to generate||set of contextsensitive filters)
(set of contextsensitive filters||conditioned on||specific input sentences)
(Approach||has||learned filters)
(learned filters||allow for||more fine - grained feature abstraction)
(learned filters||vary from||sentence to sentence)
(Approach||has||convolution operation)
(convolution operation||in||our framework)
(our framework||does not have||fixed set of filters)
(fixed set of filters||provides||network)
(network||with||stronger modeling flexibility and capacity)
(Approach||propose||generic approach)
(generic approach||to learn||context - sensitive convolutional filters)
(context - sensitive convolutional filters||for||natural language understanding)
(Approach||propose||novel bidirectional filter generation mechanism)
(novel bidirectional filter generation mechanism||to allow||interactions between sentence pairs)
(interactions between sentence pairs||while constructing||context - sensitive representations)
