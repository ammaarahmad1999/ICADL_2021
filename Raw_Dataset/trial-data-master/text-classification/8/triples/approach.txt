(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||To ac- count for||distinct nature of various NLP tasks that may require different semantic features)
(distinct nature of various NLP tasks that may require different semantic features||compare||SWEM - based models)
(SWEM - based models||with||existing recurrent and convolutional networks)
(existing recurrent and convolutional networks||in a||pointby - point manner)
(Approach||conduct||extensive experimental investigation)
(extensive experimental investigation||to understand||when , and why)
(when , and why||simple pooling strategies||operated over word embeddings alone)
(operated over word embeddings alone||already carry sufficient information for||natural language understanding)
