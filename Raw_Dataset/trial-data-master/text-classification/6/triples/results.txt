(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||As||training set size increases)
(training set size increases||has||models that do not make use of transfer learning)
(models that do not make use of transfer learning||approach the performance of||other models)
(Results||has||Models)
(Models||make use of||sentence level transfer learning)
(sentence level transfer learning||tend to perform better than||models that only use word level transfer)
(Results||observe||transfer learning)
(transfer learning||from||transformer based sentence encoder)
(transformer based sentence encoder||performs as good or better than||transfer learning)
(transfer learning||from||DAN encoder)
(Results||observe||sentence level transfer learning)
(sentence level transfer learning||for||smaller quantities of data)
(smaller quantities of data||can achieve||surprisingly good task performance)
