(Model||Fixing the vectors||is done)
(is done||by||selectively moving the vectors)
(selectively moving the vectors||to a location||in the same vector space)
(in the same vector space||that better separates||the class)
(Model||has||MCFA)
(MCFA||computes||two sentence usability metrics)
(two sentence usability metrics||to control||noise)
(noise||when||fixing vectors)
(two sentence usability metrics||name||self usability)
(two sentence usability metrics||name||relative usability)
(Model||present||neural attentionbased multiple context fixing attachment)
(neural attentionbased multiple context fixing attachment||name||MCFA)
(neural attentionbased multiple context fixing attachment||is||series of modules)
(series of modules||uses||all the sentence vectors)
(all the sentence vectors||as||context)
(all the sentence vectors||e.g.||Arabic , English , Korean)
(all the sentence vectors||to fix||sentence vector ( e.g. Korean ))
