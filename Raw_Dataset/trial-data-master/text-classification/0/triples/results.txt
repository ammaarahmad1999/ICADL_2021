(Results||Comparing with||traditional models)
(traditional models||suggests||simple use of a distributed word representation)
(simple use of a distributed word representation||may not give us||an advantage to text classification)
(Results||has||most important conclusion)
(most important conclusion||from||our experiments)
(our experiments||is||character - level ConvNets)
(character - level ConvNets||could work for||text classification)
(text classification||without the need for||words)
(Results||has||most obvious trend)
(most obvious trend||coming from||all the plots)
(all the plots||is that||larger datasets)
(larger datasets||tend to perform||better)
(Results||has||further analysis)
(further analysis||needed to validate||hypothesis)
(hypothesis||that||ConvNets are truly good)
(ConvNets are truly good||at identifying||exotic character combinations)
(exotic character combinations||such as||misspellings and emoticons)
